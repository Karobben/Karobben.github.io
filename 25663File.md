# Growth


- body index, and body composition among all trials; and substitute ratio up to 48% could have positive affect on yellow catfish. It was also shown in Pacific white shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*)[^Cummins_2017] that even 100% persent BSFL substitute to fishmeal has no significant effects on survival which agree with our experiment.
- BSFL meal and paste could replace low to moderate levels of dietary protein without compromising growth performance in Atlantic salmon[^Weththasinghe_2021].

# Immune

BSFL substitute could obviously increase the immune activity of yellow catfish up to 48% ubstitute ratio[^Xiao_X_2018]. Chitin may plaied a positive role in stimulate the inner immune activity in sea bream (Sparus aurata)[^Sanchez_M_2014].





# Fead intake

Feed intake among dietary treatments did not differ in white shrimp[^Cummins_2017]



# Body weight gain

replacing up to 61.3% fishmeal and up to 95.4% of fish oil in in ==Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*)== have positive effects on growth performance[^Rawski_2020]


## Bodyweight Gain

- ==barramundi (*Lates calcarifer*)==[^Katya_2017]:
  - [x] it **in consistence with** those of previous studies, suggesting an optimum fish meal replacement level of 20–50% using insect meal [^Wing-Keong_2001][^St-Hilaire_2007][^Alegbeleye_2002][^Cummins_2017] in different aquaculture species.
  * [X] WG and SGR of fish-fed BSFL75 and BSFL100 diets were significantly **lower**
  * **Broken line regression analysis** of average WG showed an optimum FM replacement level of 28.4% with BSFL meal.
  * Conclusion:  Replacement could be <u>greater than 28.4% but less than 50%</u>
- ==Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*)==[^Rawski_2020]
  * All treatments (up to 61.3% fishmeal replacement and 95.4% fish oil replacement) show significant increase

- ==Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*)==[^Caimi_2020]
  - growth performance and feed utilization parameters, as well as digestibility coefficients, were impaired by the use of **defatted** black soldier fly meal. My be caused by lower level of chitin in full-fat meals.

- The growth of channel catfish or blue tilapia was strongly suppressed by feeding with 100% of black soldier fly larvae (whole or chopped)[^Bondari_1987].




*[AMP]: positively affects the microbiome, which has high concentration of lauric acid (21 g/100 g of crude fat) may also play a key role in fish health—immune system stimulation, and microbiome stabilization also[^Lee_K_2020].




## Survival:
- [X] Not effects on:
    ==Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*)==[^Rawski_2020], ==Pacific white shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*)==[^Cummins_2017], or ==yellow catfish (*Pelteobagrus fulvidraco*)==[^Xiao_X_2018], 100% in five groups in ==Jian carp==[^Zhou_J_2018]


# Body index
crude protein and moisture were not much affected by the treatments[^Katya_2017]

- hepatosomatic index significantly increased in R75 group[^Zhou_J_2018]
- The conditional factor, intraperitoneal fat index, kidney index, viscera somatic index and spleen indexes, being 2.57%–2.67%, 0.59%–0.69%, 0.47%–0.54%, 0.13% –0.14% and 0.17%–0.21%, respectively, in five groups, were not significantly different among these dietary groups.[^Zhou_J_2018]

# AA
- [X] Essential amino acids including arginine, histidine, lysine and methionine were found to be higher in the whole body of fish-fed BSFL100 diet[^Katya_2017]
- [X] essential or non-essential amino acid contents in muscle of Jian
carp were not significantly different among five dietary groups[^Zhou_J_2018]

## Blood index
- [x] **Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase**, **glutamic pyruvic transaminase**, **total protein**, **albumin**, **globulin**, **glucose**, **total cholesterol**, **Triacylglycerol**, **high-density lipoprotein** and **low-density lipoprotein** in serum of Jian carp were not significantly different, respectively, among five dietary groups[^Zhou_J_2018].
- **Serum maleic dialdehyde (MDA)** was significantly decreased in R100 group than in R25 group. **Total antioxidant capacity** (T-AOC) significantly decreased in R100 group than in the other four groups (Table 10)[^Zhou_J_2018].
- **serum SOD** activity in the group fed with diet T25% was significantly higher in yellow cat fish[^Xiao_X_2018]


##  body composition
- [x] whole body composition of juvenile turbot (Psetta maxima) revealed that BSFL meal had **no influence** on **body protein** content[^Kroeckel_2012].
- [x] the **body lipid** content **decreased** with the increasing of BSF meal inclusion[^Kroeckel_2012].


# Digest

## Digestibility Coefficients
- ==Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*)==
  - **no significant correlations** among the dose of BSFL and <u>crude protein</u> digestibility (p = 0.3079) or <u>crude fat</u> digestibility


## Fat/Lipid
- BSFL contain high amounts of medium-chain fatty acid, lauric acid (C12:0)[^Weththasinghe_2021][^Spranghers_2017], which has antimicrobial effects against gram-positive bacteria[^Spranghers_2018][^Dayrit_2015][^Lieberman_2006][^Skrivanova_2006][^Skřivanová_2006]and viruses[^Dayrit_2015][^Lieberman_2006].
- Medium-chain fatty acids and mediumchain triglycerides have also been suggested to improve gut health under inflammatory conditions[^Liu_Y_2015], which might be associated with the induction of the expression of host defense peptides in the gut[^Wu_J_2020].
- Dietary fatty acid composition affected fatty acid composition of fish that had been fully certified in many fish, especially in Atlantic salmon[^Bell_2001][^Bell_2003][^Huang_2007][^Torstensen_2005]
- increasing levels of BSFLM led to a significant increase in saturated fatty acids and decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids in whole body, muscle and hepatopancreas of ==Jian carp==[^Zhou_J_2018] , which was in accordance with previous report on ==Jian Carp==[^Li_S_2016] and on rainbow trout[^St-Hilaire_C_2007].
- Modifications to the diet of the BSFLM may improve longchain fatty acid content of larvae and then enhance the fatty acid profile of fish fed BSFLM [^Sealey_2011][^St-Hilaire_C_2007]
- Choline is important in lipid transport across the intestinal mucosa of salmon[^Krogdahl_2020] and dietary choline chloride (0.37–0.4%) prevented excessive lipid accumulation in the proximal intestine in post-smolt Atlantic salmon[^Krogdahl_2020][^Hansen_2020]. In addition, the majority of fatty acids in BSFL meal were saturated[^Weththasinghe_2021] which might lead to reduced enterocyte steatosis, as observed in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) by Olsen, Myklebust[^Olsen_2000].


# Composition of BSFL

- [x] Black soldier fly was early been recognized as the potential candidate ingredient due to its rich nutritional profile comprised of 40% protein and 35% lipid[^Bondari_1987].
- [x] indicating 40–45% crude protein content in the larvae of black soldier fly [^Yu_GH_2009][^Van_Huis_2013]
- [ ] Low crud protine and high crude fat in BSFL replacement than in FM and other traditionally used protein source[^Irungu_2018][^Nogales_2019][^Józefiak_2019][^Caimi_2020]
- [x] crude protein and crude lipid have no effect on ==jian carp==[^Zhou_J_2018]






# Histology
==Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)==[^Kumar_2021]
> - BSFL protein treatment:
>   - Liver: all the diets had normal sinusoid organization with no congestion, vacuolization or evidence of inflammation
>   - Distal intestine:  FM diet (a), SBM + BSFLLow (c) or SBM + BSFLHigh diet, **no inflammation** in the villi or mucosa, and the **microvillus** were well-shaped; <s>fish fed the with **SBM** (and no BSFL) (b) showed inflammation of the villi and lamina propria in the majority of sections due to infiltrations of leucocytes. structural disintegration of the villi architecture.</s>
> - BSFL oil treatment
>   - Liver and intestine is normal in FO-based diet and SBO-based
>   - In the livers of fish fed the BSFLO and BSFLO + BA diet, there were occasional **biliary hyperplasia** (BH) and **enlarged bile ducts** (ED), respectively.

- SBM causeing elicit the **inflammatory response** in ==trainbow trout==[^Venold_2012].
- insect meals contain bioactive peptides that can **prevent or reduce** the induction of inflammatory processes in fish[^Xiang_2020]
- rainbow trout fed SBM-based diets, but with BSFL supplementation, **effectively prevented** the occurrence of inflammation.[^Kumar_2021]

# Chitin
- BSFL are known to contain bioactive compounds
such as chitin[^Finke_2013][^Caligiani_2018] antimicrobial peptides (AMP)[^Park_2014][^Park_2015] which have antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties in fish[^Esteban_2001][^Dong_X_2015][^Ringo_E_2012][^Gopalakannan_2006].
- non-amino-acid nitrogen, which is bound in chitin.
- reduction in fish growth performance with a corresponding increase in the dietary insect meal inclusion could be due to the substantial increase in chitin content [^Sanchez_Muros_2015]
- Chitin in fish nutrition—depending on the dose—is considered as a prebiotic substance or antinutritive compound which may <u>decrease feed palatability, nutrient digestibility, and growth performance</u> [^Lee_K_2020][^Gasco_2018][^Belghit_2018][^Li_S_2016][^Shiau_1999]
- The occurrence of physiological changes in sturgeon, i.e., pathogen decrease or gastrointestinal tract histomorphological alteration, as observed by Józefiak et al. [^Józefiak_2019] are also possible.
- Some fish may not affected by chitin
  - It should also be emphasized that chitin is the most commonly ingested carbohydrate in sturgeon diets, which in the early stages of growth tolerate even insect-based monodiets thus they may show higher tolerance than other fish taxa[^Volkman_2004].

- 10 g/kg of dietary chitin did not affect the growth of common carp [^Gopalakannan_2006]

-  Large chitin polymers are biologically inert, while smaller fragments are pro-inflammatory, and even smaller fragments stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine[^Lee_CG_2008].
- Da Silva, Hartl[^Da_Silva_2008] reported that 40–70 µm sized chitin fragments could trigger inflammation and cytokine production via the pattern recognition receptors in mice.


- chitin could be used as an immunostimulant when supplemented in fish diets[^Henry_M_2015][^Ringo_E_2012].
- chitin’s immunomodulating effect in fish has also been suggested to be dependent on the dietary inclusion level[^Cardinaletti_2019][^Ringo_E_2012].
- For instance, it has been reported that dietary inclusion of 1% chitin increased serum lysozyme activity in common carp[^Gopalakannan_2006], whereas <1% inclusion did not alter serum lysozyme activity and phagocytic activity of HK leukocytes in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata)[^Esteban_2001].
- However, Esteban, Cuesta[^Esteban_2001] also reported that administration of a chitin diet (<1%) enhanced seabream immune activity through the non-specific modulation of haemolytic complement activity, leucocyte respiratory burst activity and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent and a timedependent manner
- As discussed by Sánchez-Muros, Barroso[^Sanchez_M_2014] dietary incorporation of chitin stimulated macrophage activity in rainbow trout.
- Chitin or chitosan enriched diet (1%) could also modulate the immune system and the disease resistance in Cirrhina mrigala[^Mari_L_2014].
- Chitin and its derivatives such as chitosan, were also reported to have antioxidant properties[^Ngo_D_2014][^Khoushab_F_2010][^Dautremepuits_C_2004].

- BSFL also contain AMP[^Park_2014][^Park_2015]
- A previous study also reported that dietary inclusion of AMP could improve immunity and oxidation resistance in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)[^Dong_X_2015].











# Pellet physical properties[^Rawski_2020]
including pellet diameter and expansion rate (p = 0.0017), pellet density, and SV (p < 0.0001).
Pellet diameter and expansion rates were increased for the BSFL diet when the substitute lager than 30.7%.
> D: pellet diameter (mm), ER: expansion ratio (%), PD: pellet density (g/dm3), SV: sinking velocity (s/100 cm), WS: water stability (%), VI: volume increase (%);CON: control feed

# Pellet palatability
- Good palatablility:
  - Sea bream[^Murofushi_1981], Stellate sturgeon[^Kasumyan_1995], and dogs[^Kierończyk_2018]
> - Aromatic compounds[^Kierończyk_2018];

- Negtive effect:
  - Siberian sturgeon[^Caimi_2020] decrease in feed at 18.5% in defatted meal. (However, in the cited study,
it was the only source of animal protein, at a level of 75% of the diet, which may suggest a negative
effect of a single protein source in the diet or adverse effects of the defatting process)

- Neutral:
  - ==Siberian sturgeon== [^Józefiak_2019] incorporation of 20% full-fat H. illucens meal.
  - ==Siberian Sturgeon==[^Rawski_2020]

- How it works:
  - Alanine and valine, which are present at higher concentrations in BSFL than in FM, are strong extraoral
  and taste stimulants in Siberian sturgeon[^Kasumyan_2018].
  - In the case of the closely related stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus), it was shown that in the comparison of 19 ingredients that contained natural and artificial feed aromas, the most attractive in terms of smell and taste were Chironomidae insect larvae [^Kasumyan_1995].




#  Gene expression
## Immune-related inflammatory gene

*[IL-8]:proinflammatory cytokine
*[TNF-α1]: tumor necrosis factor α1
*[IRF-1]: Interferon regulatory factor 1
*[ProstD]: prostaglandin D

- Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to be released as part of the innate immune response in fish[^Whyte_2007].
- Dietary inclusion of BSFL meal has been reported not to affect the intestinal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes including IFNg and IL-1b in pre-smolt[^Li_Y_2019] and post-smolt[^Li_Y_2020] salmon.
- Similarly, dietary inclusion of defatted BSFL meal did not affect the intestinal inflammatory cytokines concentrations of *TNF-a*, *IL-6* and *IL-8* in juvenile Japanese seabass (*Lateolabrax japonicus*)[^Wang_G_2019]. In contrast, high (25IM(==25% of protein content==)) inclusion level of BSFL meal induced high levels of IFNg in DI[^Weththasinghe_2_2021].

- The IgD level in DI was not altered by the inclusion of BSFL meal and paste[^Weththasinghe_2_2021]. However, the DI IgM presented low levels in 6.25IM, 25IM and 3.7IP diets fed fish compared to Control-1. The lower DI IgM might also be related to the absence of inflammatory changes in DI histology in BSFL meal containing diets[^Weththasinghe_2_2021], because elevated IgM level in intestinal mucosa might be a sign of inflammation[^Krogdahl_2000].


- **IL-8, TNF-α1,** and **IRF-1** were influenced by the diet type in rainbow trout[^Kumar_2021]
  - BSFL protein replacement
    - <u>kidneys</u>.
      - SBM diet showed a significantly **higher expression** of **IL-8** and **TNF-α1** in the
      -  **IRF-1** was found to be **up-regulated** in SBM + BSFLLow fed fish but significantly **down-regulated** in SBM group.
      - **ProstD**: no effect among all trails.
    - <u>Intestine</u>
      - **IL-8** and **TNF-α** were unaffected.
      - **ProstD** and **IRF-1** were significantly **downregulated** in the SBM + BSFLlow and SBM + BSFLhigh groups compared to those fed the FM and SBM diets.

  - BSFL oil replacement
    - <u>kidneys</u>
      - **IL-8** was significantly higher in BSFLO+BA compared than FO diet.
      - **ProstD**: no effect among all trails.
      - **TNF-α** and **IRF-1** in deit BSFLO-based had an up-regulated expression compared to FO and SBO groups
    - <u>Intestine</u>
      - **ProstD** and **IRF-1** were higher in BSFLO+BA whereas SBO.
      - **IL-8** and **TNF-α**: No significant differences .


- **Various genes** responsible for inflammation were measured that included, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor and interferon regulatory factors.[^Miao_2018]

- In particular, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has been reported to play a key role in the genesis of proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, and chemokines mediated by inflammation as well as immune cell activation [^Lim_2016][^Collet_2020]

- ==northern snakehead (*Channa argus*)==: the expression of IL-1β (pro-inflammatory cytokine) was up-regulated after being fed diets with high SBM [^Miao_2018]
- Our result[^Kumar_2021] is in congruent with an earlier study where dietary HFL supplementations significantly decreased the hepatic expression of proinflammatory interleukin (IL-1β) and hepcidin in M. albus[^Xiang_2020]




## inflammation resposne
- replacing FM with BSFL at 75% and above, intestinal histopathological damage was noted as well as some necrotic hepatocytes in the livers of Jian Pre-proof 13 carp, Cyprinus carpio[^Dumas_2018].
- The two diets with low and moderate levels of BSFL meal, i.e. 6.25IM and 12.5IM, uniquely expressed calreticulin-like[^Weththasinghe_2_2021]. In a recent study, dietary inclusion of yeast cell wall extract increased abundance and expression of a calreticulin-like protein in the skin mucus of salmon[^Micallef_2017]. Further, calreticulin was overexpressed in the proteome of the DI of Atlantic salmon fed a probiotic feed additive 24 h after inducing inflammation. This suggest that it has a key role in many cellular and immunoregulatory functions, which help to counteract the inflammation[^Vasanth_2015]. (calreticulin(gene-calr3a) shwo sig decreased in BSFL 20 -50 in liver)
- In addition, the fish fed 12.5IM diet uniquely expressed calpain-9-like and calpain-2 catalytic subunit-like. Calpains are calcium-dependent proteases (95, 96), which regulate phagocytosis and bacterial killing in macrophages (97).



# lysozyme...

## lysozyme
- Lysozyme is an important defense molecule of the innate
immune system of fish[^Chaklader_2019][^Saurabh_2008], which is important in mediating protection against microbial invasion.
- Lysozyme is distributed in mucus, lymphoid tissue, plasma and other body fluids of freshwater and marine fish[^Saurabh_2008].

- dietary BSFL or maggot meal significantly enhanced the **lysozyme activity** in Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, marron, Cherax cainii, and black carp, Mylopharyngodon piceus, respectively [^Yixiang_2013][^Foysal_2019].
-  LZM activity was higher but not significantly different (p > .05) between the groups fed with diets T13%, T25%, T37%, T48% and T85% and the control group (T0%), and significant lower in 100% substitute in yellow cat fish.[^Xiao_X_2018]
- It has been reported that dietary defatted BSFL meal did not affect the serum lysozyme activity in Japanese seabass[^Wang_G_2019].
- However, we observed low lysozyme level in fish fed 6.25IM, but increased level in fish fed 12.5IM(12.5%)[^Weththasinghe_2_2021].
- A dose-response of BSFL meal on serum lysozyme activity was observed in yellow catfish, with higher activity at lower dietary levels[^Xiao_X_2018].
- inclusion of 10% BSFL **improved various genes** in the **head kidney** responsible for immunity in ==barramundi==, Lates calcarifer, as well as their resistance to Vibrio harveyi challenge[^Chaklader_2019].

- Lower inclusion of 26.4% of BSFL **shortened the villi** in the distal intestine of ==rainbow trout==, which was believed as the cause for a worsening of the feed conversion ratio[^Elia_2018].
- Cuasing **lipid vacuolization in the liver**, but there was **no damage** to either the liver or intestine while there were positive and negative effects to the oxidative status [^Elia_2018].






# others
- **phagocytic percentage**(%) of the groups fed with diets T13%, T25%, T37% and T48% was higher than that of the control group, but the difference was not significant in ==yellow catfish==. And it was significantly lower (p < .05) in the groups fed with diets T85% and T100%.[^Xiao_X_2018]

- Oxidative stress within cells or tissue has adverse effects on fish health, thus antioxidants can have significant health-benefits [^Stenberg_2019].

- Previous studies also reported that the activity of serum antioxidant enzymes did not alter or even increased with dietary inclusion of BSFL meal or pulp in Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian)[^Li_S_2017].yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco)[^Xiao_X_2018] and mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio var. specularis)[^Xu_X_2_2020].

- However, Zhou, Liu[^Zhou_J_2018] observed that serum antioxidant capacity was not affected by partial replacement of dietary fishmeal with BSFL meal in Jian carp, while complete replacement reduced serum antioxidant capacity.


# Safe maximun substitute



- the maximum inclusion could be as great as **20%** in the diets of rainbow trout[^Elia_2018].
- 16% is not only appropriate, but beneficial to the immunity and gut histomorphology of rainbow trout[^Kumar_2021].
- **BSF prepupae** meal could replace up to 45% in juvenile ==European seabass==[^Magalhães_2017]
-  In ==rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)==, **BSF prepupae** could be used to replace 25% of the FM and 38% of the fish oil components of a commercial diet without negative impacts on production[^St-Hilaire_2007]
- **BSF prepupae** reared on dairy cattle manure and trout offal and used to replace up to **50%** of fish meal portion of a practical trout diet for 8 week did not impact sensory quality of resulting ==rainbow trout== fillets.[^Sealey_2011]
- with a **100%** replacement of FM with BSFLM, the growth of fish was not different from the other==Jian Carp==[^Zhou_J_2018]
- Low level: The 60 g/kg dietary inclusion of BSF prepupae in ==channel catfish== [^Newton_2005], 150 g/kg[^St-Hilaire_2007] or 180–360 g/kg inclusion of BSF prepupae in ==rainbow trout== [^Sealey_2011] and 50–250 g/kg inclusion of BSF prepupae in ==Atlantic salmon== (Lys and Met)[^Lock_2014] had shown a similar weight gain to that of fish fed fish meal.
- high level: inclusion levels (120–300 g/kg) reduced fish growth significantly in channel catfish, in rainbow trout and in turbot[^Kroeckel_2012][^Newton_2005][^St-Hilaire_2007]
- high level - negtive effects: 330 g/kg inclusion levels would significantly decrease the palatability of the diet, protein digestibility, feed intake and growth performance in turbot[^Kroeckel_2012]










## high substitute Negtive


- A high percentage of dietary FM is replaced with BSFL meal, **palatability**, **feed intake** and **nutrient absorption**, decreased (==Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)==)[^Burr_2012].

# BSFL Oil
- ==C. carpio==: Replaced SBO with BSFLO from 0–100% in the diets and found[^Li_S_2017]:
  - no difference in growth
  - increase in intraperitoneal fat(likely due to a significant upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression)

- ==Rainbow trout==: no negative effect on the use of dietary BSFLO when included at 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0% on the[^Dumas_2018]
  - growth
  - feeding efficiency
  - gut histomorphology
  - believed even higher inclusion levels were possible

- Compared to the FO treatment, upregulation of **IL-8**, **TNF-α1** and **IRF-1** in the kidneys which could be due to an immunostimulatory effect of the BSFLO. increase in **lysozyme activity**, significantly higher **peroxidase activity**[^Kumar_2021]

- Dietary BSFLO increased the intraperitoneal fat content of C. carpio when replacing SBO [^Li_S_2017]

- In this study[^Kumar_2021], the BSFLO had **no significant effect** on the **expression of genes** responsible for inflammation in the intestine or any evidence of **excessive lipid storage** in the liver.

- When **lauric aicd** consumed by animals, lauric acid is quickly oxidized rather than being stored in the liver leading to reduced feed intake [^Belghit_2019] and controls obesity in mammals [^St-Onge_2008][^St-Onge_2002]

- BSFLO improved the **oxidative status** and reduced the expression of **pro-inflammatory genes** in C. carpio and was superior compared to those fed diets with oils from silkworm pupae or yellow mealworm [^Xu_X_2020].




# Microoganism

- BSFL meal increased the abundance of beneficial microorganisms that contribute to the health of the host such as lactic acid[^Huyben_2019][^Terova_2019][^Rimoldi_2019]and butyrate[^Terova_2019].
- The anti-inflammatory properties of microbe-derived butyrate in gut and its role in enhancing intestinal barrierfunction and mucosal immunity are well studied in human[^Liu_H_2018].
- It is also possible that the short-chain fatty acids including butyrate produced by gut microbiota might induce the expression of host defense peptides and prevent inflammation in the gut as observed in mammals and birds[^Wu_J_2020].






# Organ health

## Intestine

- The gut is considered as the main site of exposure to nutrients and antigens[^Martin_2017]. In a normal and healthy gut, almost no vacuolization is observed in the enterocytes of the proximal intestine[^Li_Y_2020].
- Increased vacuolization of the enterocytes in the PC is called **enterocyte steatosis**, which reflects an abnormal lipid droplet accumulation within the enterocytes due to impaired lipoprotein synthesis[^Olsen_1999][^Olsen_2000] or lipid transport across the intestinal mucosa to the circulatory system[^Gu_M_2014].
- This condition is observed in fish affected by the so-called lipid malabsorption syndrome[^Krogdahl_2020].
- Such enterocytes might cause damage...damage can translocate pathogenic or potentially pathogenicbacteria into the host and, having detrimental effects on fish health[^Olsen_1999][^Olsen_2000].
- Li, Kortner[^Li_Y_2019][^Li_Y_2020] have also shown that post-smolt salmon fed diets containing 15% BSFL meal and pre-smolt salmon fed diets with 60% of dechitinized BSFL meal presented a lower degree of enterocyte steatosis in the proximal intestine.


## Liver

- **Liver**: an up-regulation of a stress-related gene in the liver of rainbow trout fed diets containing 21% full-fat BSFL meal for 98 days, suggesting a physiological activation of stress/inflammation response[^Cardinaletti_2019].
- defatted BSFL meal did not cause negative effect on liver health in salmon as indicated by decreased or unaltered activities of plasma markers of liver damage such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)[^Belghit_2019][^Belghit_2_2019], and unaffected expression of genes related to stress response in the liver[^Belghit_2_2019].
- ALT and AST are enzymes present in liver and spleen, and leak into the bloodstream upon liver cell damage; therefore, high levels of these enzymes in blood are indicators of the liver damage[^Zou_H_2016].
- In addition, Belghit, Waagbø[^Belghit_2_2019] and Vargas-Abúndez, Randazzo [^Vargas_2019]: observed that dietary inclusion of BSFL meal did not affect the expression of genes involved in stress response **(heat‐shock protein‐70 and superoxide dismutase)** in the liver of pre-smolt salmon and clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) respectively
-  On the contrary, increased expression of **heat‐shock protein‐70 gene** was observed in the hepatopancreas of Jian carp fed BSFL meal diets, suggesting an induced stress response only when dietary substitution of fishmeal exceeded 75%[^Li_S_2017].



## Muscle

- On the other hand, CK is concentrated in muscle and heart tissue and CK (creatine kinase) in the blood indicates damage of these tissues[^Wagner_2004].


# Blended

- Dietary inclusion of defatted BSFL meal (60%) or partially defatted BSFL meal (15%) did not compromise gut health in pre-smolt[^Li_Y_2019] and post-smolt Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)[^Li_Y_2020], respectively. Further, partially defatted BSFL meal in diets (20–40%) caused no adverse effects on the histology of liver, spleen and gut in rainbow trout[^Elia_2018].
- In the present study, plasma AST, ALT and CK levels were not affected by BSFL meal, suggesting that dietary BSFL meal might not affect liver and muscle health.[^Weththasinghe_2_2021]
- In agreement with the present results, dietary inclusion
of BSFL meal did not affect the plasma CK (creatine kinase) level in rainbow trout[^Dumas_2018] or intestinal CK in Japanese seabass[^Wang_G_2019].

- CRP (C-reactive protein) is an acute-phase serum protein and a mediator of innate immunity[^Valdenegro_2014]. The blood CRP level is increased in response to acute infection, inflammation or tissue injury[^Edagawa_1993][^Roy_S_2017]. Further, the serum CRP level was increased in rainbow trout reared in unfavorable environment, i.e. high-water temperature[^Kodama_2004].

- according to the polynomial contrast analysis, plasma
AST and CK levels tend to increase at 3.7% replacement of
protein with BSFL paste[^Weththasinghe_2_2021].
