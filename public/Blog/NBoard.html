<h2 id="10-05"><a class="header-anchor" href="#10-05"></a>10-05</h2>
<p>Hi, dear.</p>
<p>I had a very interesting dream yesterday.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I got lots of blog visitors when I woke up in the morning. I was so excited because I thought you were back. But, no, You are not. People came from all different provinces except Heilongjiang. That’s funny. But what’s even more fun was when I wake in reality, I found that I got 17 visit records and you still not included. Just like the dream. So, at least, I am not feeling so sad cause it is exactly what I expected.</p>
<p>I was slept with hugging Tidy the whole night recently.<br>
Cause this is the only way that makes me feel we are close to each other.<br>
I miss you so much, dear.</p>
<h2 id="10-04"><a class="header-anchor" href="#10-04"></a>10-04</h2>
<p>Hei, Shan, Thanks for visiting.<br>
Finally, I saw your visit record last night and it was so exciting.</p>
<p>I slept with hugging the Tidy yesterday night and dreamed about You messaged me with Wechat.<br>
You send me a photo and withdraw it before I saw it.<br>
By the second, I am doubting it was you are your parents.</p>
<p>I dreamed about your father mild his hostility against me. But the truth is, of course, it is impossible, otherwise, you can get your phone back and we can talk.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about me. I can totally live fine here. I have friends here. I have Tidy. And of course, I have wages enough me pay coffee every day.</p>
<p>I just…<br>
I miss you.<br>
I miss you so much.</p>
<hr>
<p>I want have some wine now. For keep me numb enough to feel nothing.</p>
<h2 id="10-03"><a class="header-anchor" href="#10-03"></a>10-03</h2>
<p>Hey, how are you?<br>
I still didn’t have a message from you.<br>
I become so worried and, a kind of panic, now.</p>
<p>I know that I’d better start preparing for my exam. But I just don’t want to do anything.<br>
I checked and refreshed the cell phone and web pages all day and still got nothing.</p>
<p>Whenever I held the breath to refreshed the page with some expectation, all I got are an endless disappointment.</p>
<p>I have no idea about why and how you just disappeared like that.</p>
<p>It makes me reminded another similar scene. Did you remember the thing I told you before? I liked the girl and we texted each other every day. But after graduation, she just disappeared for no reason. It seemed like gonna happen again. What I have done last time was I spend 3 years making sure that she just wanted to get rid of me. I am not the man who’ll stick your like a chew-gum or sort of things if you don’t like it.</p>
<p>If this is what you want, just give me a word and fine, I’ll live. I don’t want to be a foolish like before to waiting years for nothing! You know how to contact me and there are so many ways to achieve it. And you do know that I don’t mind waiting at all. But please, don’t disappear with nothing records left.</p>
<h2 id="10-02"><a class="header-anchor" href="#10-02"></a>10-02</h2>
<p>Just as every day I did, searching for the phone and checking if there was nothing new from you.</p>
<p>I got one visited record which made me happy cause I thought it was you.<br>
But soon, I fall into disappointment.</p>
<p>Today is laundry day. I put as many lab coats as I can into the laundry machine and playing Pokémon while waiting for the next schedules.</p>
<p>Yeah, I almost forgot to say, good morning! Hows you feeling today, to your vocation!</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s night now. I still didn’t watch even a single page of the book.<br>
But I watched all the latest Pokémon episodes.</p>
<p>You know, I am not a big fan of traveling. But ever time after I played Pokémon, I can hear the call from the outdoor-world or the wild. I got a desire to explore the new place and have communication with strangers just as I always done in the Pokémon world. And soon, I killed this idea and just sit on the sit and wondering nothing.</p>
<p>I do not hate to exploring the outside, to traveling. But I just don’t want to do it along.<br>
In the Pokémon world, I am never along since I have six partners in my pocket. They can protect me from danger and they are always a good topic to start with strangers. They gave me the brave to heading into any place without seconde hesitation.</p>
<p>I can be totally alone when I doing studying or research. And Actually, I am kind of enjoying it.<br>
But when the issues come from daily life, I prefer to postpone them or even evading them since I don’t want to face them alone.<br>
It makes sense that I don’t like to do haircuts, go shopping, buying any cloths even though those problems bothering me a lot.<br>
And I am waiting for one who can do them with me in the future. At present, I believe that you are that person, the person who can give me the brave to facing and killing all those problems and I’d definitely willing to do everything for you.</p>
<p>Both we lake of a part in our hart. But luckily, both can we fill those parts for each other.<br>
How fantasy can we meet each one in this crowded world.</p>
<h2 id="10-01"><a class="header-anchor" href="#10-01"></a>10-01</h2>
<p>Can’t say I am not disappointed about getting nothing from you.<br>
No messages replays, no visited records for a few days.</p>
<p>I woke up early today and checked my phone as a find it, but nothing news.<br>
There is no reason for me to get up from the bed. I just wanna decade on hearing without noticing. Hope I can be ignored and forgotten by the world.</p>
<p>But soon, I have to claim the deliveries since some precious potions have arrived and I need to place them in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>After that, I tossed the garbage and cleaned some plates and their silicon-plastic cover. I also compared and analyzed some data until lunchtime.<br>
The boring morning is gone.</p>
<p>I opened the Windows system to play Pokémon Ultra Sun just like yesterday night.<br>
I was missing this game so much. Everything in the Pokémon world is so beautiful and fantasy. Most kids in the Pokémon world are born with goals: be a good Pokémon trainer, be a pokémon researcher, doctor, or teacher. Everyone (NPC) in this word is so nice and friendly though they can replay yours with repeat lines only. By speaking with those people, you can get tips, hints, or items. Sometimes you can get “useless lines” like jokes, personal proclamation, or sort of things to help you understand what the game team wants to tell us and teach us. I even enjoy this more than the Pokémon battle. I am really enjoying this world which I’d like to call it paradise. Even though I agree with the claims on the Internet that the pokémon world is so evil, people are treating pokémon are more like slivers rather than the friend or the partner. And the truth is you are collecting them either for forcing them to battle or achieving your accomplishment of collection and stored them on the computer and may never wake up them again. But what so ever, it doesn’t reduce my affections. I just enjoy this game very much. And this is so much of the Afternoon.</p>
<p>I still no idea and worry about the future, the variation, and not confidence about myself.<br>
Yeah, and I don’t want to talk about this here, too. It’s too silly.</p>
<p>I am not good. But, not bad, too.<br>
I just kind of lost.</p>
<p>What so ever, I checked out the massages before you sent me.<br>
It seems like you were doubting my feeling or words of feeling to you.<br>
So, I won’t update as frequently as before.</p>
<p>I’ll just update when I have emotion burst.<br>
Or maybe, I’ll just delete this page, someday.</p>
<p>Thanks for your accompany before.</p>
<p>.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.</p>
<p>Yeah, I regrade. I’ll take it back.<br>
I lost your connections already.<br>
I can’t let both of us disconnected.<br>
So, I’ll update as frequently as possible.<br>
Happy festival!</p>
<h2 id="9-30"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-30"></a>9-30</h2>
<p>I was so excited that the vocation is coming.<br>
What makes me so happy is that I expected to get your massage.</p>
<p>But, satirically, I got nothing.<br>
I have no idea what’s going on about you.</p>
<p>Maybe, you had a deal with your parents;<br>
Maybe, you are mad with me for not replay your massages;<br>
Maybe, you just don’t like to talk with a coward like me.<br>
Or maybe, you just feel tired with me and got someone new for hang out with.</p>
<p>I am still refreshing my cell phone from time to times, and check all different social media accounts I have.<br>
None of them has tacks from you which disappointed me a lot.</p>
<p>But, it’s fine.<br>
Really fine.<br>
I am good along all the time.<br>
Really.</p>
<p>Other wise, I have the tidy bear.<br>
I’m not along actually, isn’t it, Tidy?<br>
Tidy? Please answer me.</p>

I’d like to talk nothing, see no one.</p>
<p>I’m cold but I don’t want to ware more.<br>
Staying hungry made me feel alive since this is the only craving-feeling I have now.</p>
<p>Just a period madness and don’t need even worry about me.<br>
I’ll back normal soon.</p>
<p>I was fall into sleep last night with your voice recording.<br>
It was so peace and gentle.<br>
Thank you.</p>
<h2 id="9-18"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-18"></a>9-18</h2>
<p>Dear Shan,</p>
<p>I burned oil whole night, again. I got to bed at 4:10 am. And then, my fellows wake me up again since there are some issue about the machine. As a result, I backed the bed until 4:45 am.</p>
<p>I think my healthy issue is deterioration. My neck and head is burning ever day.<br>
I can’t have spare time to studying and update my knowledge. All of those against my expectation, working with spare time to studying.</p>
<p>I have to go now.<br>
But don’t worry. I’ll have more spare time after next week.</p>
<p>Again, it was so nice to hear your message in the Thursday night.</p>
<p>Love you<br>
KK</p>

<p>Dear Shan,</p>
<p>It was so warm that you messaged me last night.<br>
But I am sorry for replaying nothing.<br>
I have no idea why I’d like to keep the distance with you.<br>
We are sharing pure spirit now. This is the best kind of thing I can imagine actually. As I said before, I want to find a person who can I trust entirely and give up all my wold, if needed. And I finally found a one, it is you.</p>
<p>What am I doing today is putting you in my heart, in my mind. So I can remember you whenever I am happy or not. Just like you are around me all the time. It maybe sounds kind of sick, but I don’t care. I am doing this for you, or for my sick psychic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am so interested in your expectations and, of course, the things which you said you own me.</p>
<p>I was so tired now and so, nothing much to say here today.<br>
Just, be good to yourself and happy every day.</p>
<p>Love<br>
KK</p>
<h2 id="9-16"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-16"></a>9-16</h2>
<p>It was quite busy yesterday night. I went to bed around 5 am. It’s a kind of disaster.<br>
But I woke up at 9:45 am. So, I just had about 4 hours of sleep. I’m feeling kind of disgust and my lung is burning.</p>
<p>But I am still busy now. So, I can’t update the latest news around me.<br>
But I don’t want to disappoint you if you find nothing when you checking this page.</p>
<p>Oh, dear. I’ll talk about things around me later.</p>
<p>And, love you.<br>
Just want to let you know I am missing you so much!</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, I got a precious spare time at 13:22 am.<br>
I can explain everything now.</p>
<p>Yesterday night, I got a rude customer who was yelling at me on the phone all the time which makes me feel so depressed and afraid about to responding the call again. The customer was so angry about our efficiency and said he wants to accuse us of reparation about time and his samples. That was so stupid and rude.</p>
<p>Expect that, we had so much of orders to sort. So, when everything settled fluently, I was so tired and feel a little bit regrade about everything, why should I do this all? Why should I steel staying here though I can’t see you again? Why should I stay in the city I even not dare to walk on the street? No idea. And it was 5 am already. I have to go to bed immediately.</p>
<p>I woke up at 9:45 and went to the lab for checking the experiment I have down last night. I downloaded the raw data and analyzed the result by my script written by python, and it succeeded. That means our work will know stacked here duty lack of the important agents (药品溶剂…).</p>
<p>Then, the manager suggested that I can go to learn something from the engineer who was repairing the machine at that time. But soon, he led me to his office and asked me something about the lab.</p>
<p>I answered everything I know and gave my suggestion. And I point out the problem we are having now. He listened to it carefully.</p>
<p>After that, he opened the true topic of today, the manager from Beijing had heard about how can I analysis the data and facilitate the working with my programming skills and want to <strong>assign me to Beijing</strong>. But he fared about that I’ll leave here to Beijing because currently, here need people more intensely than Beijing. All folks here are new bees. The oldest worker had been serving this lab for less than 1 month. As for me, I am been here for only three weeks, but I am the only guy who can respond to customers’ questions about their data and smoothing the working flow here. And he also pointed out that the reason I am working here is because of my girlfriend to test me if I was really want to stay here.</p>
<p>Be honest, I’m not interested in Beijing at all. I don’t care about the salary, I don’t care about the expense or even the achievement from the job. What I care about is that I need enough time to study, reading, and miss you. Though I am steel not daring to walk street along. But I don’t care. The only reason if I go to Beijing is I can focus on programming. But at present, I can program whenever I want. And on the other hand, we are pretty close in physically! We are leaving in the same city, breathing the same air, feeling the same weather, not sharing sun and moon only from thousands of miles before!</p>
<p>Maybe I have written too much for today. Hopes you’ll not feel too boring or tedious.<br>
So, I’d like to stop here and say good-bye.</p>
<p>Dear Shan, hope the good weather has a positive effect on your cold.</p>
<p>Love you!</p>
<h2 id="9-15"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-15"></a>9-15</h2>
<p>What a fine day!</p>
<p>Hope the warm and gentle sunshine could disperse the virus from you.<br>
It seems it happened a lot yesterday night. And I wish I can be with you and borrow you a shoulder.</p>
<p>So sorry to hear about what happened from your grandfather. No idea about what to say to relieve you.</p>
<p>I watched all the words you send me and felt so touching though most of then are trivial things. Thanks for sharing everything. That’s exactly why I’d like to take the risk to accept you and love you. You are always so honest and frank about everything to me. This makes me feel so safe and your are worth-trusted. It also makes me believe that I am the guy who worthy you to sharing with.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that I can’t replay to you when I was in the work.<br>
During the night, I laid on my bed with my head against the bear you give me, and gently pave its hand as if it is you. But the fur is just too rough to compare with yours and it definitely made me even missing you more!</p>
<p>I was missing the scent of shampoo from your hair, the smell of detergent from your clothes which make me crazy shivering as you can feel when I huge you.</p>
<p>I still remember the last kiss, which was so gentle, so soft, and so sweet.<br>
I could even see you with holding a bag of ice sticks fading out of my sight after you kissed me…This is the last time I saw you!</p>
<p>This scene was so bright and warm, just like one sitting in the backyard to reading a thick book, holding and drinking a cup of hot coffee, basking on the sunshine in the winter afternoon. It’s just so fantastic. How I want to see you again!</p>
<p>How I want to see you again!</p>
<h2 id="9-14"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-14"></a>9-14</h2>
<p>From now on, this week, my working time is from 3 pm to midnight.<br>
So, I’ll update this page in the morning.</p>
<p>I just have done a data statistic script which is written by R.<br>
I think maybe I waste too much time on programming. So, I decided to give it up totally this week: no programming at all.</p>
<p>So, I can spend my energy in English, vocabulary, speaking, reading, and writing.</p>
<p>Just for making sure that you know I have also updated this page yesterday night.<br>
Sorry for I missed your message last night. After I responded to it, I was waiting for your replay all night. But there is no new messages. (/Huge the bear)</p>
<p>Hope you are feeling better now. I know is just a cold, but it can make you feel uncomfortable and disgusting. I wish I can stay around you and give you a huge whenever you not feeling so well.</p>
<p>As for your talking about change, I believe that you needn’t change yourself intentionally at all. Just be yourself and don’t bury the true side of you deep into your heart. You know, I’ve accepted the darkest side of you, and I don’t care about anything worse than that. I love you and love you all, not the few tiny shining parts of you.</p>
<p>just be yourself, and hope I can see you soon!</p>
<h2 id="9-13"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-13"></a>9-13</h2>
<p>I skipped a day of the recording.<br>
It was so nice to see your text messages again which I waited for a whole week.</p>
<p>I was nervous. Not only I am afraid of missing your messages so I checked my accounts frequently, but also I have no idea about what should I say.</p>
<p>Again, so good to hear something from you, though most of them are trivial things.</p>
<p>But whatever, I am recording trivial things almost every day.</p>
<p>This morning, the important system we use for importing working sheets didn’t work well. I tried a few alternative ways to import the sheet and it wasted me for a half hour.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to learn something about Machine Learning. But I can’t install the package, <code>xgboost</code> appropriately. And I spend another half hour to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to take a shower and washing my clothes. And then, the morning has gone when everything was done.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I finally decided to work on the data I collected before. I want to build a model by machine learning algorithms to evaluate the success or failure of the result. I love data analysis.</p>
<p>I updated the <a href="https://karobben.github.io/Blog/R_abi_re.html">page</a>. But all of the notation and explanations are in English.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was waiting for your response all the time. I was checking my account frequently but there is nothing new from you.</p>
<p>So desperate to hear something from you even if you are totally bubbling.</p>
<p>I miss you, I want to see you!</p>
<h2 id="9-11"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-11"></a>9-11</h2>
<p>ummmm… 昨天还是看了一晚上小说, 没有学习.<br>
妳还好吗? 不会真的感冒了把 - -<br>
怎么会, 明明可以, 历史记录找到这个页面的呀, 怎会, 找不到呢?<br>
昨天没有进这个页面把…<br>
不过妳居然找回了, SSW, 也是, 厉害的. (decode 了吗?)</p>
<p>今天工作还算顺利, 不过因为, 东西多, 而加班了一个小时.<br>
有个队友, 因为爱钻牛角尖, 还爱怼人, 所以被大家嫌弃了.</p>
<p>今天接了好几个客户的电话, 被抱怨了很多. 等下还要, 去给他发结果.<br>
所以我得, 晚点睡了.</p>
<p>因为, 去食堂的晚, 没菜了, 所以只能点外卖. 浪费了很多时间等外卖.<br>
继续看那本书. 里面居然有, 主人公(女)和勾引已婚之夫的剧情 = = 真是…<br>
不过, 因为是英语的, 所以, 就算有什么描述, 就算我旁边围着很多人,<br>
我都可以堂而皇之的阅读, 不用担心任何人, 瞟到什么, “不可描述” 的内容.</p>
<p>晚饭, 我又吃一半, 留一半, 明天吃.<br>
有个瘦瘦的女生. 他们打趣, 说, 要不以后, 我和她订一份, 分着吃算了.<br>
我想也没想, 就随口答应了. 可是转头一想, 啊… 好像不大好的样子<br>
毕竟我已经不是单身了, 哈哈哈, 苦笑.<br>
所以, 还是继续自己, 每天吃一半, 留一半把.<br>
不是省钱, 不是自虐. 只是真的, 不喜欢吃多.<br>
再说了, 留着钱, 买咖啡吃, 多好啊.</p>
<p>今天还没结束. 我还能学习, 或看书, 或写作.<br>
嘛, 要不, 以后的, 我用英语写把.</p>
<p>对了, 今天天气很好呢.<br>
夕阳, 如妳似醉</p>

<h2 id="9-10"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-10"></a>9-10</h2>
<p>如妳所见, 我把外面的链接给删了.<br>
嘛, 好些了吗? 没有感冒把?<br>
唉 :-(</p>
<p>今天工作很顺利, 没有加班. 为了表现积极点, 晚了一个小时走.<br>
帮忙干点杂活.</p>
<p>昨天说好的, 写论文, 但是没有写.<br>
买了本小说, 电子的. Conversation With Friends.</p>
<p>日常生活篇, 女主是诗人, 爱自由. 让我立马想到了妳.<br>
ummm, 所以昨晚没有写论文. 今天任然不想写, 想继续看…</p>
<p>算了, 还是, 写吧. 写到, 9点, 再看.<br>
所以, 写论文, 凑字数去了.</p>
<h2 id="9-9"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-9"></a>9-9</h2>
<p>9月9了.<br>
想起一首老歌, 走到9月9.</p>
<p>某人和我说, 感觉要感冒了来着. 不会真的病了吧?<br>
这个时候, 感冒, 可难受了吧…</p>
<p>不知道, 头疼, 我也, 头疼.</p>
<p>工作很顺利, 没有加班.<br>
晚上, 看了几页小说. 准备继续写论文了.<br>
写吧. 今天, 也没什么值得高兴的事情.</p>
<h2 id="9-8"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-8"></a>9-8</h2>
<p>早上实验很顺利，质粒很快就提完定量了.<br>
不过, 在做PCR的时候, 引物没有稀释, 导致拖到了, 吃完饭以后<strong>重做</strong>.</p>
<p>今天食堂的饭菜很恶心, 黏黏糊糊的, 还是酸口和甜口, 还是鱼…<br>
吃了蔬菜, 其他都没吃.</p>
<p>下午虽然没加班, 但是非常难开心起来.<br>
实在是没什么, 能够让我开心起来的事情.<br>
突然想吃零食, <em>脆香米, 悠哈软糖, 大白兔</em>…<br>
明明我是最对零食, 无感的…<br>
看看新闻; 买了本电子的书, 没看.<br>
晚上, 才, 看看书.<br>
明天记得写论文把 - -</p>
<p>左下角那位, 喂喂喂, 妳咋能,<br>
天天笑的这么开心呢</p>
<h2 id="9-7"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-7"></a>9-7</h2>
<p>终于早班了. 连着反了好多错误. 辛亏发现及时, 所幸都挽救回来了.<br>
先是加错药品, 不能裂解细菌.<br>
后是忘记上样本, 就直接洗脱 = =.<br>
最后浓度提出来的, 偏低. 还好能用, 不过.</p>
<p>下班了. 晚上, 不能像昨天一样的, 听某人碎碎念, 好不习惯.<br>
拖着, 好多计划好的事情, 都没开始做, 就已经睏了.</p>
<p>做个视频把, 好久以前拍摄的, 沫蝉的照片. 合成个视频<br>
…做到一半放弃了- - 看英语去吧, 还是</p>
<h2 id="9-6"><a class="header-anchor" href="#9-6"></a>9-6</h2>
<p>加班几天了, 今天终于可以休息了.<br>
超累, 起超晚.</p>
<p>考试被取消了, 考位只能, 地点, 日期, 一个个查. 手太累了.<br>
利用脚本, 来自动点击, 全国各地找托福考位, 很快就找到了</p>
<p>看到大家工作都超级负责, 新人还有主动要求加班来学习的. 23333, 可厉害了.<br>
羞愧, 看来我也不能, 老想着摸鱼了.</p>
<p>完善了画图脚本, python 的. 可以直接, 读取文件夹, 给出结果.</p>
<p>虽然实验结果不大好… 不过至少说明我的脚本挺好<br>
<a href="https://imgchr.com/i/wmCyRJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/09/06/wmCyRJ.md.png" alt="wmCyRJ.md.png"></a></p>
<p>晚上, 看个<code>刀剑</code> 的更新<br>
再看看论文, 看看妳的消息.<br>
一天过去了</p>
<p><strong>晚</strong><br>
感觉自己就是个演员.<br>
悲伤, 哀愁了一下午. 同事来了, 瞬间就开始,<br>
笑脸, 开玩笑, 打趣.<br>
感觉像漫画里的, 躲在笑脸面具后面哭. 搞笑的很.</p>
