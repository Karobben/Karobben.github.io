<p>Let me tell you about my mom. My mom was 42 years-old when I was born. And she started exercising for the first time in her life. She started by running around the block. And then, she started doing 5km raises. And then, she started doing 10km raises. And after that, she ran a marathon. And after that, my mom did it <strong>Drasalon</strong>. By the time, she was 57 years-old. My mom was tracking up hell to the base camp of mountain everest. And let me tell you about my dad. When I was a kid, my dad used to take me to the science classes. He was also my calculus teacher in high school. I want to craw under the desk. I learned something important from my mom, the value of health. And I learn something important from my dad, the value of science. And, this two values have guide me on my track through life. And they found me appreciate the epidemic we are all facing, and it’s not Ebola. Instead, it is the epidemic of unhealthy living.  </p>
<p>A half billion people world wide are OBS. And you would think that 50 year after that first US surging general support on the dangerous tobacco was published. That we be beyond of the problem of smoking. Today, a billion people worldwide use tobacco. Tobacco and obesity are two of the most preventably causes of premature death. Solving this problems is like trying to solve <strong>Ajecstuck</strong> puzzle. We are engaging in unhealthy behavior because of our genetics, because of brain neural transmitters, because of environmental effluences such as pills and media. Each of those pieces of puzzle are not things you and I can solve on our own. But, there is one piece of this puzzle that may hold the key, our choices, about what we do with our cravings to engage in addicted behaviors like smoking, or over eating. Our choices. There is a new science of self-control that may hold the key to reversing that epidemics. It’s called willingness.</p>
<p>Willingness means allowing you craving to come and to go or not acting on that, like smoking or eating unhealthy. But actually, I’m not talk about will power, I’m not talking about power through your cravings. Instead, I am talking about different notion of cravings. That looks like this, dropping the struggle with your cravings, opening up to them, letting them be there, and making peace with them.  </p>
<p>Now, at this point, you maybe very skeptical. I was. When I first heard about it years ago, I friend of my came to me with a book on willingness. He said, Jonathan, this book will changing your life for every. And I said, Ooh, ok, yeah, umm, year, I’ll check it out. So, I went through it, ummm, it is a bunch of psychical bible. I tossed it aside. Until some years later, when my wife brought me to a work shop on unwillingness of university of Washington. And I was <strong>bullowned</strong> away. So then, I read the book, and then, I read a lot of book on willingness. And I got trained in it. And what I learned was willingness is apart of acceptance in the accept and commitment therapy approach to be behavior change. It’s a broad approach to be behavior change, it’s been used to help people with anxiety disorder, with addictions, even some innovative companies are now using it to helping improving their employees performance and reduce their distress.</p>
<p>Now, to understand why I was billowed away, you have to understand the world that I live in. In my research world, a common way you help people quit smoking and lose weight is you teaching them to avoid cravings, avoid thinking about smokings, distraked yourself from food cravings. There’s a song from a Broadway’s show, and <strong>capshows</strong> this perfectly, it goes like this.</p>
<p>When you start to get confuse because of fuzzes in your head, don’t fell thoughts feelings. Hold them in instead, turn it off, like a light switch just go click we do it all the time when you feeling certain feeling such as don’t seems right, switch those packing feeling like a reading light, and turn them off.</p>
<p>We all living in this world, with the song we keep hearing is turn off the bad feelings. Now, let’s take a look at this cookies. They just came out of the oven. Ooooh, they are so good. Oooh, they are so delicious. Enmmm, just feeling the craving to eat that feelings. Oooh, they are lovely, they are so good. Now, turn it off. turn it off. You want this cookies even more now, right? You see the futility of “turn it off”. You can’t turn it off. And maybe, you don’t have to. Maybe, you can leave the light on. Here is how.  </p>
<p>My research lab at Fred Parkinson Cancer Research Center here in Cato. It’s conducting random-mize clinical trails to see if showing people how to be willing to have their craving is affective to quite smoking. We are conducting trails in face to face intervention, and a telephone quick smoke hot-line, and a website called webquite.org, and an App called smart quite. This technology help the potential to reach millions people with their interventions, we could save life. That’s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>And let me tell you about the data. When you pull together the result from six clinical trials, all six had been published today, including trails conducted by our colleagues. What we see is that for the people who were signed to the avoid approach, avoiding your cravings, some of them quite smoking, and very depending on the study. However, for the people who are randomly signed for willingness condition, twice as many quite smoking. Every every encouraging.<br>Now, of course, the date only tell us one part of the story. So, to help you see willingness in action, I am going to wave together experiences I’ve had to consulting people to quiting smoking. And our together refer, so there is one person we’ll just call him Jane.</p>
<p>So, as this is typical people who coming to once helping quiting smoking, Jane was a 45 years-old person, who started smoking when she was a teenager. She tried quite smoking several times but not successful. So, she was very skeptical that  anything new was getting be helpful to her for quite. And she was really hopeful that this time would be different. So, the first thing that I show Jane was to be willing, that is to be aware of her craving in her body. So, to know this where she cravings in her body. And when I did it this to asking a journal that, and just to track the intensity over time, and see if she smoke afterward. So, a little bit of explain that she stops me, she saids, “what are you talking about? I don’t have cravings. I just smoke”. So, I said, “Well, why not you try it, and we will see what happens, and if doesn’t happens, we try something else”. So, she came back a week later. She said, you know, “I am dragging my cravings. I have been dragging them all the time. And now, I can’t stopping thinking about smoking. What am I suppose to do?” Well, if I tell you, my answer, let’s look behind the sites. Well, what’s probably going on here was that Jane was having craving all alone. And like a lot of us, she lives on autopaletor. You wake up in the morning, smoke a cigarette, you have a cup of coffee, you smoke a cigarette, you get in to the car, you smoke a cigarette. We are often just not aware what we thinking before we act. So, I answer to Jane was to be willing. And one of the way I show her to do that was what the exercise called, I am having the thought. So, one of Jane thoughts, before he had cigarette was, I fill a lot of stress I know, I really need a cigarette. So, I ask he after freeze, I’m having the thought, like this. I’m having the thought that I’m feeling lot’s of stress done, I really need a cigarette. Than, I asking her another phrase, I notice that I have the thought. So, I’m noticing that I’m having the thought, then I having lot’s of stress now, I really need a cigarette. Now, we can all do an exercise like this when we have any kind of negative thought, like for my thought, that I’m boring all of you by my talking. And, I’m having the thought that I’m boring all of you with my talk. So, what the exercise did is give me a little bit space between me and my thoughts. And it’s in that’s space, that I can choice not to run out of the stage from 500 people. And the fact is, we don’t act on every thoughts we had because if we did, we all be in hall a lot of trouble. So, this was helpful to Jane. But there was something else, that was really difficult for Jane, and I feel lot’s of compassion about her. And that was the judgment that she feel from people when she would be outside smoking a outside cigarette. There criticism from her husband for been a smoker, and the self-loading that she developed about smoking, and she dealt with ashame, by having a cigarette which give her relive temporarily into the shame came back. So, I said to Jane, what would be like if we tried to honer this feel of shame as part of human experiment. If you had a close friend, who was feeling ashame about smoking, I said to Jane, “What would you offer to this friend as words of caring very kindness? And could you then, offer those words to yourself Jane.” And she looked up, and she had this look of this temporary respite from the shame which made just a little bit easier to next time, not acting to craving.</p>
<p>So, here is the secret of self control. The secret of self control is to give up control. Because otherwise, we get into a target of war with a monster, a craving monster. And a craving monster saids, “Common, smoke a cigarette; common, have that cookie; Common!” And you are on the other side say, “No, craving monster, I’m gonna distract by you; I am ignoring you, no no no” And the craving monster says, “Yeah, you know, common, you know, you want it.” And you just back here, you are going back and forth and back and forth, and pretty soon, the craving monster over powers you, you have the cookies, you have that cigarette until the craving monster come back. And you are on the target word doing again. Doing what we learned how to do. In last, in last, you drop the rope. And when you discovered is if you just allow the monster to be, to occupy a space in your body, you discover that that the craving monster is not as threatening as it appears. And some times, it even goes away. As we break for lunch, we gonna have choices what to eat. When you see them, try to be aware of the craves in your body. Try to be willing to have this craving, see if they passed on there own. And whatever choices you made, try to bring a spirited of caring and kindness to yourself, for that is the mountain that we are all climbing. Thank you very much!</p>
