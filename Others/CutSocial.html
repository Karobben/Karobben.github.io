        <h3 >Why Do I Wanna Do this</h3>
        <p  class="post"><br><br>
          After a few days of self-inspect, I made a hard decision, to cut off my main internet social networks for about a week. 
          I am almost 25 years old and preparing for TOEFL and GRE, and I am very active in a QQ, Wechat, and Bilibili, 
          the places I can find my "friends" and sense of belonging, sense of existing. What I find is that I did not fully focus on exam preparation, 
          but waste lots of time on those social networks. For example, the first thing I did every day is grasping my cellphone first, 
          opening eyes, and then, checking if there are any new massages: I am deeply addicted to it and as a result, I believe I need change right now. 
          Though the internet is the heavens for me, the one who is not good at making new friends from strangers face to face, 
          I have less than 5 people on the frequent contact list. I find that I can acquire huge self-achievement from the massages who send to me because it makes me think: 
          there is a guy who contacted with my first! Is that mean I am popular? Or what did they say? What did they want to know from me? 
          Those unknown questions make me feel excited and look forward to the new massages. As a consequence, 
          I will fall into the vacuum after that ephemeral happiness, or feel hugely depression if there is nothing updates after checked for all social apps. 
          It exposed lots of my frailties, for instance, desiring to be notified, be commanded and lack self-control, 
          self-motivated, etc. Of course, I am not mean that I am totally useless and the people like me are worthless because I believe that we are human: 
          it is normal that we have such weaknesses and all of the weaknesses could be counted as merits under some specific circumstances. 
          But under the current condition, I'd better have good self-control and fine attitude on virtual social networks rather than losing 
          control and letting the desiring rampant and take over of my mind--I can not submit to my wild calls further or my life will be harder at now and in the future. 
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3 >Day 1</h3>
        <p  class="post"><br><br>
          At present, I'm feeling good. Without QQ, Wechat there is nothing I can check and reply. Without the expectations form those Apps, 
          I 'm not looking forward to getting new messages anymore. I'm just keeping contact with my friends with text message who lives near 
          the center of the epidemic since he is under isolating due to one of his family involved in the event.<br><br>

          Some times, I want to share some jokes in QQ groups, but soon, I realize I am under the "Isolating Experiment". So, 
          I just write a script to help me to update all the pages in a folder and post this article to record my little experiment.<br><br>

          Actually, I'm frequently trying to send or check the massages from Apps and recoding the times when this idea popping out in my mind. 
          As a result, I tried more than 86 times to use social Apps! It looks sound for a cellphone abuser and I think it is acceptable for the Day one.<br><br>

          What I find is that I am really addicted to Social network Apps: when I get bored, I want to send/check my messages; when I am happy, I want to share with Apps; 
          when I feel tiring, I want to check the messages to kill the time; when I am annoyed, I want to find consolating from the cell phone; when I am helpless, 
          I want to ask for help from the QQ groups; when I am frustrated by questions, I want to eschew and fresh the cell phone. In other words, 
          whatever happened to me will turn me to the cell phone.<br><br>

          But anyway, I do done more jobs than the previous day though I am frequently distracted by missing the Social Apps. 
          I finally realized that how am I addicted to them and postponed routine tasks. I can definitely do better with the limited use of those Apps. 
          There is a voice in my mind frequently suggesting me to reinstall them especially at night, 
          but I am fighting with this voice and this fight will be lasting for a week to finish my experiment. 
          And I'll record my daily experience and changes that happened to me and share it with you who are addicted to virtual social networks and trying to make a change 
          but don't know how to start it. So, let's expecting what will happen in the next few days.<br><br>
