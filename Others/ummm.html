        <p style=" font-size:20px;"><br>Karobben<br>24 Feb 2020<br></p>
          <p  class="post"><br>

            I am the most who are willing stay at home, rather than go outside, go social, etc. As a result, the latest Epidemic, has not affect me at all. 
            But, of course, it does affect me, indirectly.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>Spring Festival</h3>
          <p  class="post"><br>

            As an Chinese, the lunar year, or Spring Festival, is the most important day for me. Most of us will spend the joy time with our families. 
            I still remembering the previous days I crossing the year with my parents. I was too yong to stay clear for that long. So, my parents would 
            woke me up at like 11:50pm to crossing the "old year" and enjoying the senery that all people launch their fire works at 12:00 am to brightening 
            the sky, blassing the new year. After I grown up, I have a new tradition -- crossing the year with my friend made in middle school. We have 
            done for so much years and had lots of fun. We made the plan of new years party and it is cansaled, of course.<br><br>

            At the end of this year, my family and my uncles family gethered before the TV to watching the  show. Ad I was 
            install a new system -- Deepin 15.11, which has a very beautiful desktop environment, but, you know, poor software circle and a few bugs. 
            I remember that I started to make the R 3.6.0 from the source code at lunar year 2019, it was still making at 2020, and it ended up with error. 
            Ha, that's funny.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>My Blog</h3>
          <p  class="post"><br>
            After that, I was still staying at home, with my family. I am feeling pretty good. I was processing a group of commercial data. I am trying 
            to write a word or ppt report. But, as you know, it is luxury for linux platform. I had terrible experience with Lib office, and so, I tried 
            WPS and it was keeping craps. As I got an advice from a QQ group, I started to try to writing my report as a Html file. I got huge confidence and 
            felt lots of self achievement from this project. So soon, I decided to re-start my blog, GitHub Page, at 20th Jan. At the same time, I noticed 
            another online notes tool, Yuque Notes. So, I started to upload all my notes online.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>Edge of Broken</h3>
          <p  class="post"><br>
            As with the days running, i still feeling good and preparing for GRE, updating my blog, writing some scripts and post some vedios. 
            But my family, especially my mom, falled into anxious and anxious. She was walking in and out between her bedroom and living room frequently, 
            quarrelling about the Epidemic, making phone calls to all the people she can in the contact list, singing songs very loudly. 
            It makes me feeling a little bit of annoying.<br><br>

            About 12nd February, my mon was leaving and go to her home town to live at uncle's home, her second old brother. 
            My father decided to stay to company with me. I still feeling everything is normal except I have to postpone the examination day. 
            But it is okay, cause I can have more time to prepare for it.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h3>A Bad Decision</h3>
          <p class="post">
            At 22nd, Feb., I made a very terrible decision--to go home town with my Dad. He think it might good for my pysical and psychological since 
            I spend such a long time to stay at home, my little bedroom. After we were arrived to my uncle's house, you know, like all house in vellige,
            the senery is beautiful, the farm land filled with followers, the tranquill river runs slowly, the brize bring you with fresh smells of grass 
            buds, the scared birds yelling and flappying their wings, the mosses covered on the adobes beside the pond, and welcome to the spring! 
            But those things were not enough to lighten me up or smooth my heart. I was still filling stress and worry about how should I to spend the next 3 days. 
            Firstly, there hadn't a table for me to place my laptop. I can't use my laptop to studying or working. Secondly, we have a hudge different racipe. 
            I have a less fatty and salty dietory. But they are really enjoy the food wiht lots of oil and salt, and flavored with heavy spicy.
            So, it is easy for me to having a diarrhoea if I eat them too much. Finally, the poor hygen condition. Be honestly, I am not really care about this proplem 
            too much, since I was living at the place for days or even months where had bader hygen condition than here. Usally, I was usually got 30 to 50 bug's bite if 
            I spend a night at her house. On the other hand, the restroom is ther worst place where I don't want even mention about. Because they are still keeping the tradition 
            of collecting the urine to fertilizing the crops. So, the restroom is really smelling. But I still chosen to come with my Dad... What the heck me??? 
            I must broken my brain to make that decision. 
            <br><br>

            But I have to admit that this senery is beatuiful and I love it. You know, Running in the intricate road on the farm land with my little nephew, breathing the familiar 
            smelling from the river, smelling the geen leaves and followers on the farm, touching the sorf geen moss besides the pond, seaking and shacking the biggest banboo 
            infront of my grandfather's house, searching bugs from the grass, litsenning the birds crying and flappying wings, sitting and watching my parents playing the cards, 
            and enjoying the beatful sunset are the life of so many of people dreaming about. But I can't fully unravel myself to enjoying those. I still doesn't habe a job, still preparing 
            for the TOEFL and GRE exaims. I want to keep myself busy and this is the only way to make me feeling serenity at present. I tried to open my laptop and worked for a while, but soon, 
            my neck was killing me and warning me to have a break. So, I have to close it and go outside to watching the sky and stay numb.
            <br><br>

          <h3>Rescure</h3>
          <p class="post">
            Luckly, one of my cousin was comming back. Because of the epidemic, my another older brother decided to drive him home and go back at the day since exposing in public is not 
            a wise choice. That means I got a chance to escape from here imeadiatly. So, I am felling batter now. Cousin is working and I stay at home to study and updating this page. 
            I mitght update more in the furture to record the 2010 Wuhan epidemic's effecat on me, on my family.
