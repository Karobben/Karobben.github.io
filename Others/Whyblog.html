        <p style=" font-size:20px;"><br>Karobben<br>11 Feb 2020<br></p>
          <p  class="post"><br><br>
            The most directed reason that made me start my blog is that I find writing <i>Html</i>
            is very fun, and you can free from the framework of <i>Word</i>, do whatever you want. 
            (The truth is Microsoft Office is not working on Linux, and <i>WPS</i> crashes all the time. 
            So, I tried to write an <i>Html</i> report and my boss liked this report ^_^)
            <br><br>
            Another reason is I want to practice my English. You know, there are not too many
            opportunities for Chinese students to practice their English skills.
            And so, running an English blog means, I need to post some English comments and papers. It's a very good chance
            to practice the <i>Html</i> skills and English at the same time. It was just like one stone, two birds!
            So, please don't get mad at my mistakes and I will try my best for each sentence.
            And feel free to correct my mistakes. I'll appreciate every comment and they are very valuable to me.  
            <br><br>

          <h3 >When & How Am I Started with <i>Html</i></h3>
            <p class='post'><br>
            I can't remember exactly when, but I think, it could be 2018, when I know this
            thing from an online bioinformatical course, and I tried to write a "hollow World" page.
            Soon, I think it could be fun if I can write my notes with <i>Html</i>. Because <i>word</i>s are easily deleted from Word files
            without any notice. You know, back then,
            I am still using Office <i>Word</i> to recode my code for <i>ggplot</i>, or codes of some software like <i>Trinitiy, blast+</i>...
            Yeah, it is true. None of my friends were studying CS back at that time. So, I don't know what <i>Atom</i> is,
            or what <i>VS</i> is. Except for the <i>Note pad, Word</i> is the only text editor I know. But, soon, I found it was
            so hard for a beginner to write a full <i>Html</i> page. And at the same time, I learned how to use <i>vim</i>. So, I began using <i>vim</i> to
            record or my notes and scripts. It is the first time I have missed my chance to master this powerful tool.
            <br><br>
            After that, I saw <i>Html</i> files from time to time. As you know, some packages like <i>plotly</i>, <i>network 3d</i> and <i>worldcloud</i>,
            some software like <i>fastQC</i> and <i>fastq</i>, they can output <i>Html</i> graphics or reports. I even tried to write an <i>Html</i> feel with a
            python script. But I still feel very struggle by a year later when I am writing an <i>Html</i> report. It is very hard for
            laymen to do things like that alone. I have made some progress in that report. But due to heavy academic work and nobody guided me. 
            So, this report discouraged me a lot. Since that, I think <i>Html</i> is very hard and doesn't want to write it again. This is the second time I lost my chance to learn it.
            <br><br>
            A few weeks before, I tried to write a report with <i>WPS</i> in <i>Deepin</i>, a Linux distribution which has
            a very beautiful desktop environment, but as worse GUI app environment as all Linux systems.
            Before it crushed my patience and passion, I still believe <i>WPS</i> is the best choice
            in Linux. Thanks to it beating my face, again and again, I decided to download a website template and
            feat my report in it. But I still don't know how to write an <i>Html</i> report. Luckily, I got lots of help from experienced friends in a <i>QQ</i> group.
            They answered so many naive questions of mine, how to insert an Html graphics, for instance,
            which has given me a great moral to continue dealing with <i>Html</i>. And under their suggestion, I tried to use the <i>VS code</i>,
            which helped me a lot, too. To be honest, without this group of friends' help,
            I can never have the courage to learn this new knowledge and maybe given it up again.
            <br><br>
            </p>
          <h3> What Do I Learn from It</h3>
          <p class='post'><br>
          About a month later, which is now, I re-opened this github IO for pracitcing the skill of writing <i>Html</i> and English.
          I am still a baby and an amateur in this area. I still have no idea how to start with a blank paper. So, I can start a page by only
          adapting website templates with an open license. But I am still enjoying writing my blog, recording my growth and learning.
          And I'd like to share this experience with people. I saw many of my friends who claim to learn
          <I>R</I>, to learn <i>python</i>, or to learn English. Even though, I tried to offer my help, like, sharing books,
          sharing my codes, experience, and free online courses. But almost none of them made progress.
          They were given up too quickly to enjoy any progress. So, here, I'd like to tell those people 
          who are feeling blind and helpless when they are learning something new that doesn't give up easily even if
          you're feeling lonely and helpless. Please, try to make the most use of the resources you have, asking for help from your friends, if not, then 
          Dor. Google, finding an on-line chat group, reading tutorials and blogs, and finally, taking notes and recording your progress and/or achievements.
          You can do better than you expected. Take me as an example. If I didn't give up learning <i>Html</i> two years ago, I
          can build a much better page than this, I can have hundreds of posts by now, I can have better English composing skills now.
          So, whatever we want to do or plan to learn, it's extremely important to keep your patience and passion to pursue it.
          We can harvest the fruits only if we pay with insistent caring.
