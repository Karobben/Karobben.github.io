tmux is a very powerful interact-able bash interpreter. Once you familiarized with the hot keys, it would be an inextricable programs of you.

Copy and Past:

^b [ (ctrl+b [) : move the mouse;<br />^blanck: start to selecte; (hold this at less for a second)<br /> ^w: copy

Now, the selected words are in your copy list. You can using the favorite way to copy it in terminal, or Word, Atom, etc.<br />A typical way to past in tmux is:<br />^b ].


Or you can:<br />^B [;<br />Using mouse the select a target;<br />^w;

It works on turmx, but not on my laptop since when ever I typing ^+blank, the stupid Sugou Input will pop out and interrupt the processor...
