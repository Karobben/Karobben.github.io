excerpt: "This guide illustrates how to visualize the range of available point shapes in the `ggplot2` package of R. By creating a data frame with a sequence of shape numbers and plotting them using `geom_point()`, users can easily identify and select suitable shapes for their data visualization needs. The resulting plot provides a clear representation of each shape, labeled with its respective shape number, allowing for quick and informed decisions in chart design."

## **Introduction**

Data visualization is an essential aspect of data analysis, allowing us to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in our data. In R, one of the most popular packages for data visualization is `ggplot2`. Among its many functions, `geom_point` stands out as a fundamental tool for creating scatter plots. In this blog post, we'll delve deep into the `geom_point` function, exploring its basic grammar and how to customize the appearance of points in your plots.

## **Basic Grammar and Code Example**

The basic grammar of `geom_point` is straightforward. At its core, you need a dataset and aesthetic mappings. The x and y aesthetics are the most common mappings used with `geom_point`.

Here's a simple example:

```R
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)

# Basic scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

This code will produce a scatter plot with the x and y values from our sample data.

## **Customizing Point Appearance**

1. **Changing Point Color**

You can change the color of the points using the `color` argument inside the `aes()` function:

```R
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color="white")) + 
  geom_point()
```

If you want to color points based on a variable, you can do so by mapping that variable to the `color` aesthetic:

```R
data$group <- sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE)

ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=group)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

## Show the name of group on the center of scatter points

```r
data_group <- aggregate(cbind(x, y) ~ group, data=data, FUN=median)
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=group)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_label(data = data_group, aes( label = group))
```

## **Changing Point Size**

To change the size of the points, use the `size` argument:

```R
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point(size=3)
```

## **Changing Point Shape**

`ggplot2` provides various shapes for points. You can change the shape using the `shape` argument:

```R
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point(shape=17)
```

Shapes are represented by numbers. For example, 16 is a solid circle, 17 is a triangle, and so on. You can explore the `?points` documentation in R to see a list of available shapes.

## **Conclusion**

The `geom_point` function in `ggplot2` offers a flexible and powerful way to create scatter plots in R. With just a few lines of code, you can produce a basic plot, and with a few more tweaks, you can customize it to your liking. As you continue your data visualization journey, remember that the key is not just to make plots look good, but to make them convey the right information effectively.
