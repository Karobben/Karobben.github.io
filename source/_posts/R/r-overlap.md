## overlap

`overlap`: The overlap package provides functions to calculate and visualize the overlap of two or more density distributions. The `overlapEst` function can be used to calculate the overlap of two density distributions, while the `overlapPlot` function can be used to visualize the overlap.

```r
library(overlap)
library(ggplot2)

# Generate two random lists of numbers
set.seed(123)
list1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
list2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 8, sd = 1)

# Calculate overlap density
overlapEst(list1, list2)

ggplot() + geom_density(aes(list1, fill = "list1"), alpha = .5) + 
  geom_density(aes(list2, fill = "list2"), alpha = .5) + theme_bw()

```

## overlapping



```r
library(overlapping)

# Generate two random lists of numbers
set.seed(123)
list1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
list2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 8, sd = 1)

# Calculate overlap density
overlap(list(list1, list2))
```

$OV
[1] 0.1431085
</pre>

I personally believe that this result is more reliable.
