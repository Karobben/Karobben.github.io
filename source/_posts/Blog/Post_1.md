Today, I just finished the subject-1 of my license.

There's been a lot of episodes before I finish it. But whatever, the result is good, I passed the exam.

But what made me writing is nothing about the license, it's something connected to my academic career, and it'll definitely affect me in the future.

I was writing a paper with my ex-teacher who is a very kind and tolerant person and focusing on Aquatics. If it is accepted, it'll be my first paper in my academic career. As you can see, how significant it is for me. We agreed on most parts of the paper except one, which I devoted lots of time and energy to and felt very satisfied with it. As a result, I lost myself and believe that I must be right about it and this part would be the shiniest section of the whole paper. So, instead of deleting them, I asked one more time for perfecting this section and hoped that maybe she would concede my idea after I polished it.

So, I started to google and read more papers to find evidence to strengthen my hypothesis. After about a half-hour, I looked back at my data and just realized that I dug it too deep to find the way home. It reminded me of common scenes in WuXia World that someone who gained the secret scroll which records the best KunFu in the world. But because it was the best, it was the hardest, too. It takes time to accept and digest them before they can really muster it. But they were desperate to muster it in a short time. So, they can not learn it well and result in hurting themselves or even becoming mad.

As for me, I just believed that I was pretty close to doing something like that, too. Bioinformatics is a very powerful skill that I'd like to learn. It's not hard to follow the pipeline, but it's hard to make your own pipe to match your data. Though the connection of genes was revealed well according to cited papers, the expression changes and limited morphology data indicate that the relationships in this experiment were way complicated than I believed.

So, I quickly re-adjusted myself and conceded my mistake. Luckily, she was so patient with me rather than directly against and denying me. Because if she did that and it definitely evokes my reverse. Then, I'll dig the hole far deeper than this time and stack myself in it.

I’m lucky at this time.  But I may not have the same fortunes every time. So, I need to keep wise and clear to avoid this. Hoping it’ll never happen again.
