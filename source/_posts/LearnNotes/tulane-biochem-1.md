## Structure of Water

*[tetrahedral]: 四面体

**What makes water unique**
1. **Dipole**
    - oxygen is tetrahedral (sp^3^ hybridization)
    - 4 orbitals
    - 4 pairs of electrons
      - 2 of them bind to protons
      - 2 of them are just orbitals
    - orbital is not completely random
      - Electrons spend more time around positively charged protons.
      - which cause the water **dipole**
    - In a right distance and right angle, they'll form a hydrogen bond

    - In the water, there are lots of polar, dipole interactions which **not form hydrogen bonds**.
    - Hydrogen bond was much dominant in the water interaction with other biomolecules.

2. **Small Size**
    - small size and so, you have extrema abundant of a polar group.

### Hydrogen bond

>How it formed:
> - Require hydrogen donor (δ+) and hydrogen acceptor (δ-) groups
> - A hydrogen acceptor has a free electron pair
> - Hydrogen is shared between the groups
> - Separation and geometry are conserved
> Common Atoms you know
>  - **Oxygen** has 2 bonds and 2 free electron pairs (only accept)
>  - **Nitrogen** often has three bonds and 1 free electron pair and sometimes 4 bonds and no free electron pairs (accept other protons)
>  - **Carbon** has four bonds and ==NO== free electron pairs and does not form hydrogen bonds

**Double bonds** make the atoms in a co-plane.

### Other things about water

The number of hydrogen bonds
> - Liquid water: **~3** hydrogen bonds/molecule.
> - Ice: **4** Hydrogen bonds/molecule.

Quantity:
> - The molar concentration of water is ~55M.
> - The concentration of Hydrogen bonding groups in water is 220 M.
>   - Which makes water is extremely polar
>   - This character drives the most unique properties of the water

## Common Chmeical Group
- Remember them all in slides - -
- Thinking about hydrogen bonding.

### DNA pairs

## Ionic Interaction

All polar molecular has dipoles. This property makes them can interact with a hydrogen bond.
The water automatically circles the dipole molecules by ion interaction.

- charge-charge (==can over distance==)
- Dipole-dipole (weak than c-c)
- charge-dipole interactions
  - Exp: water circle the charged particles to form a water shield.
  - it limited the charge-charge interaction
  At the surface of the protein, not surrounded by water, the interaction of molecules here could become much stronger. (Con contain? ion, not shield by water)

*[Dielectric]: 电介质

> - Dielectric constant of the medium (weaker in more polar solvents)
> - Ionic strength of the solution (weaker as ion concentration increases)

### Hydrophobic Interaction

The measure of the non-favorite interaction of nonpolar molecules

A non-polar molecule or group is "Hydrophobic"
doesn't solve into water

Being nonpolar, not really interact with water.

> - surface tension
> - water molecules can’t H bond with nonpolar solutes so they H-bond with each other, forming a “cage”
> - this ordering (entropy) is unfavorable
> - the hydrophobic effect is proportional to the nonpolar surface area that is exposed to water


Exp:
1. a bottle of water, take non-polar (CH~4~) into the water, happens nonthing
2. remove water-water interaction: lost some classic phenomenal

### summary of interaction energies

- Covalent
- Ionic
- Hydrophobic
  - Thermol dynamic favorable.
- Hydrogen Bond
- Dipole-Dipole
- Induced dipole (Van Der Waals)

### Ionization of Water

$H_ 2O \longleftrightarrow  H^ + + HO ^ -$

$$
k = \{\frac{[H^ +][OH^ -]}{[H_2 O]} \} = 1.82 \times 10^ {-16}\ Molar
$$

Since H2O is constant (55.3 M), we can write
$$
K^ * = k[H_2 O] = [H^ +][OH^ -] = 1.01 \times 10^{-14}
$$
which usually rounded into 10^-14^
$$
pH = -log([H+])
$$

### Ionization Equilibria

low Ph -> proton concentration is high in water
high Ph -> low proton concentration

$$
pK_ A = -log(K_ A) = -log(\frac{[H^ +][A]}{[AH]})
$$

$$
pK_ A = -log([H^ +])-log(\frac{[A]}{[AH]})
$$

**Henderson-Hasselbach Equation**
$$
pK_ A = pH - log(\frac{[A]}{[AH]})
$$


Middle of the curve is pK~a~: point tow portion equally abounded




## Thermodynamic and Energetics

> - High energy compounds
> - Metabolic pathways - glycolysis

Second Law of Thermodynamic
In biology, we focus in:
- constant pressure, constant temperature

$\Delta H - T \Delta S < 0 $ is the energy we can use

$- \Delta G$ is spontaneous, is a thermodynamically favorable reaction

$aA + bB \longleftrightarrow cC + dD$

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^ {\circ} + RT\ ln[\frac{C^ c D^ d}{A^a B^b}]
$$

> ==The rate of a chemical reaction is INDEPENDENT of $\Delta G,\ \Delta G^ {\circ}$==


$$
\Delta G ^ {\circ} = - RT\ ln[K_ {eq}]
$$


> - Enzymes ==CAN NOT change== the equilibrium concentrations in a reaction
> - Enzymes ==can ONLY allow reaction== to proceed towards equilibrium


> Metabolic pathways
> - often operate far from equilibrium
> - are steady state pathways
> - are irreversible because at least one step has large negative $\Delta G ^ {\circ}$


> - The forward pathway is highly favorable (the sum of all the ΔGo is negative)
> - Flow through the pathways is from A to J (the sum of all the ΔG is negative)
> - Reactions 2,6,7 and 8 are near equilibrium
> - Reaction 4 (D→E) is highly unfavorable
> - Reactions 1,3, 6 and 9 are highly favorable
> - Reactions 1,3 and 9 are far from equilibrium
