excerpt: "The avian immune system exhibits a unique immunoglobulin (Ig) system characterized by distinct features absent in other vertebrates. Birds possess a specialized IgY, which serves as the functional equivalent to mammalian IgG and IgE, but with significant structural and functional differences. Unlike mammalian systems, birds utilize a limited number of germline gene segments and rely on gene conversion within the bursa of Fabricius to generate antibody diversity. This mechanism allows for a rapid and diverse immune response, showcasing the evolutionary adaptation of birds to their ecological niches and pathogen challenges."

## Specific in Birds

Until 2024/5/23, the only annotated bird in IMGT is Chicken. According to the IMGT, chicken heavy chain gene has only [1 functional V gene ](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=genetable&species=Chicken&group=IGHV), [3 functional D genes](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=genetable&species=Chicken&group=IGHV), and [1 J gene](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/index.php?section=LocusGenes&repertoire=genetable&species=Chicken&group=IGHJ). This is hugely difference from human or other mammals.

Birds have three classes of antibody: **IgM** (the only class in all vertebrates), **IgY**, and **IgA**. Not been directly determined but inferred from size estimates of the intact molecules of **IgM** and **IgA**, they could form ==polypeptide chains==[^Lundqvist_2006]. In addition, ducks have a smaller form of IgY, called IgY (ΔFc).

- IgM is the only class of antibody that is found in all vertebrate. IgM is larger than that of a true tetrameric IgM, such as occurs in teleost fish[^Leslie_69] and thus both are likely to be pentameric.
- IgY is the major low-molecular weight form of antibody found circulating in birds, where it has sometimes been referred to as IgG. An IgY-like molecule is likely to have been the evolutionary precursor of both IgG and IgE immunoglobulins[^Parvari_88][^Magor_94].

## Chicken

The generation of antibody binding-site diversity is very well understood for the chicken:

- Reynaud CA, Anquez V, Grimal H, Weill JC. A hyperconversion mechanism generates the chicken light chain preimmune repertoire. Cell. 1987;48:379–88.
-  Reynaud CA, Dahan A, Anquez V, Weill JC. Somatic hyperconversion diversifies the single Vh gene of the chicken with a high incidence in the D region. Cell. 1989;59:171–83. 



## Duck

Anseriform birds (ducks and their relatives) are the closest relatives of the chickens which was well understood and be studied.

Ducks have the same hematopoietic tissues as chickens, including bone marrow, gut associated lymphoid tissue, spleen, thymus and the Bursa of Fabricius, a specialized organ for B lymphoid development. However, there is one notable difference. Ducks have lymph nodes, which are completely absent in chickens[^Flajnik_MF_03].

> 1. a single functional rearrangement of the variable (V) region, like chicken.
> 2. generate diversity through gene conversion from a pool of pseudogenes.
> 3. V region element and the pseudogenes appear to consist of a single gene family (The same as the Chicken)
> 4. Further analysis of 26 heavy chain joining (JH) and 27 light chain JL segments shows there is use of a single J segment in ducks.
> From: Lundqvist M L, et al.[^Lundqvist_2006]

The overwhelming evidence is that all birds express only a single class of immunoglobulin light (L) chain[^Magor_KE_94][^Reynaud_CA_83] most closely related to the λ chain of the mammals [^Grant_JA_97][^Kubo_RT_70]. The suggestion of additional classes of L chain in the birds [^Leslie_GA_77] has not been substantiated at the amino acid sequence or genetic level.

### Duck IgY

Ducks IgY:
  - secreted form
  - a receptor form with a hydrophobic membrane-spanning C-terminus
  - truncated form termed IgY(ΔFc)

Difference and similarities in other species:
  - No truncated form: Chickens express only the full-length and membrane-receptor forms of IgY[^Parvari_88].
  - Has truncated form: A small form of IgY (5.7S) is produced by some species of turtles[^Leslie_72].

Duck immune response inept:
  - lacking: precipitation, agglutination, complement fixation and opsonization[^Grey_67][^Humphrey_04] (related the lacks an Fc region).

### Duck IgA

**IgA** has been described to date only in mammals and birds
- secretions of the gut, respiratory and reproductive tracts, as well as in tears, bile and (in mammals) the milk
- IgA of mammals is typically a dimer.


- **Duck IGH**:
  1. a single family of VH sequences
  2. a single expressed JH element
  3. JH is immediately downstream of a D segment
- **Duck IGL**:
  1. there are few functional coding VL and JL elements in the germline
  2. diversification most likely arises in large measure from gene conversion events from an extensive suite of germline VL-related sequences; (Genomic Southern blot analysis showed that there is a large family of germline VL-related sequences in the mallard duck[^Magor_KE_94])
  3. It is not known whether there is a single functional V and J element in the duck L chain locus, however, that is the simplest explanation of the results.
  4. muscovy duck were at least two functional VL genes[^McCormack_WT_89].
  5. a single family of VL sequences
