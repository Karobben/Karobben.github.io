## Nuclear receptor research: recent topics

• Transcriptome and proteome analysis
• Crosstalk of nuclear receptor with other signaling pathways: PI3k/AKT, STATs, mTOR, PKA, PKC
• **Epigenetic** regulation of NRs: non-coding RNAs, histone modificication
• **Non-canonical** NRs: mutants, splice variants
• **Non-genomics** actions of nuclear receptors
• **Therapeutic targeting**: SERMs, SARMs, etc



## Terminology

• Ligand: the signaling molecule. It may be a hormone, a growth factor/cytokine, a steroid, a polypeptide, or other type of molecules. The ligand has no activity of its own, it must bind to a macromolecule which is known as a receptor.
• Receptor: protein molecules that bind to ligand with high specificity. When activated by the ligand, the receptor induces changes in the target cells/tissues in which it is expressed.
• Hormone response element (HRE): the specific motif on the DNA to which the receptor binds.
• Dimerization: one protein molecule forms a complex with another, usually via non covalent bonds. The protein molecules can be the same (homodimer) or different (heterodimer).

## The mode of signaling is determined by the chemical nature of the ligand

• **Lipophilic or hydrophobic ligands** such as steroids can pass through the cell membrane and thus use **intracellular** receptors.
• **Hydrophilic ligands** such as peptides and growth factors cannot pass through the cell membrane and thus use **cell surface** receptors.

## Hormone signaling



## Nuclear Receptor: Classical Definition

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of structurally similar, ligand-activated transcription factors that reside within the cells. Upon binding to ligands, NRs exert their functions in the nucleus and regulate the expression of genes with a wide range of physiological functions, such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cell death, etc.

### Type I Nuclear Receptor (<u>Steroid Hormone Receptors</u>)
- Including ER, PR, AR, GR, and MR
- Ligand-dependent transcription factors
- Unliganded receptors reside in the **cytoplasm**, form a complex with **chaperones** (heat shock proteins and immunophilins)
- After binding to ligands, translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA as **homodimers**.
- Hormone response elements (HREs) are **inverted** repeats.

### Steroidogenesis Pathway

Adrnal Cortex
- Aldosterone
	- Stimulates renal reabsorption of Na⁺ and excretion of K⁺.
- Cortisol
	- Increased Glucongenesis
	- Anti-inflammatory
	- Protein breakdown in muscle

Ovary
- Estrogens
	- Control menstrual cycle
	- Promote development of female secondary sex characteristics.
- Progesterone
	- Secretory phase of uterus and mammary glands.
	- Implantation of maturation of fertilized ovum.

Testes
- Testosterone
	- Stimulate spermatogenesis
	- Promotes development of male secondary sex characteristics
	- Promotes anabolism
	- Masculinization of the fetus

### Type II Nuclear Receptor (RXR heterodimers)

- including receptors for retinoid acid (RAR), vitamin D (VDR), thyroid hormone receptor (TR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
- Ligand-dependent transcription factors
- Unliganded receptors are in the **nucleus, bound to DNA** in the promoter of target genes, **interact with co-repressors**, and **repress** basal transcription
- bind to DNA as **heterodimers** with RXR
- in the presence of ligands, undergo conformational change, dissociate from co-repressors and recruit co-activators
- HREs are **direct** repeatsLigands for Type II Nuclear Receptors


## Ligands for Type II Nuclear Receptors

Type I: ERl; AR; GR
Type II: RAR; TR; V~D~
- thyroid hormones
- retinoids
- vitamin D

### Direct repeats of Type II HREs

Same repeat patterns but different length in the insertion:

VD~3~RE:3n
RARE:5n

### Type III Nuclear Receptors (Orphan Receptors)

- including Rev-Erb, ROR, ERR, NGFI-B, SF-1
- In general, are located in the **nucleus**, bound to DNA and **repress** basal transcription
- Activation through signaling pathways or unknown ligands
- Bind to DNA either as monomers, or homodimers, or heterodimers with RXR

Dimeric orphan recptors and monomer orphan recptors

### Domain Organization of Nuclear Receptors

A/B → C → D → E → F
A/B: N-terinal domain
C: DNA binding Domain (DBD)
D: Hinge domain
E: ligands bindg domain
F: C-terminal

### Sequence homology of Nuclear Receptors

DNA binding domain: most conserved one

Degree of similarity: DBD > LBD > NTD

### N Terminal Domain (NTD)

- Highly variable among NRs. Unstructured or structurally diverse.
- Type I NRs have large NTDs (400-600 a.a.); Nonsteroid receptors have much shorter NTDs (VDR 24 a.a.)
- Contains Activation Function -1 (AF-1) domain, which is responsible for ligand-independent activation.
- AF-1 synergizes with AF-2 in the LBD.
- NTD is involved in co-regulator recruitment. AR has ~150 co-regulators interacting with AF-1.

### DNA Binding Domain (DBD)

The most conserved domain among NRs. Contains two zinc- finger motifs. Responsible for binding to hormone response elements (HREs).

#### Zinc Finger Motifs in DBD

- Evidence for role of zinc fingers in receptor function:
	- Site-directed mutagenesis destroys DNA-binding
	- Chelation of zinc in vitro destroys DNA-binding
- 1 st zinc finger has **P-Box** (Proximal Box), critical for sequence recognition and contacting the **major groove of DNA**.
- 2 nd zinc finger has **D-Box** (Distal Box), which is involved in **dimerization**

### Evans R M Molecular Endocrinology

### Where are the P-boxes and D-boxes?

### Hinge domain

--==K==--------==RK==----==RK==--

Between DBD and LBD, confers flexibility to NRs. Also contains Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), which is critical for nuclear translocation of Type I NRs. NLS motifs are highly conserved in type I receptors.

### Ligand Binding Domain (LBD)

Moderately conserved among in sequence, but highly conserved in secondary structure. There are 12 α-helices forming the ligand-binding pocket.

H12
H3
ligand binding is not static, is dynamic.

LBD contains the ligand-dependent activating function-2 (AF-2) domain, which is involved in recruiting coactivators.

### Positioning of H12 determines the activity of NR

NCoA: nuclear receptor coactivator (==L==xx==LL==)
NCoR: nuclear receptor corepressor (==L==xx==II==xxx==L==)

### Ligand-induced conformation change in the LBD

Ligand binding leads H12 movement

### H12 conformation change is used in drug design
DES: diethylstilbestrol
Fraydoon Rastinejad et al. J Mol
Block the movement of the H12, hinder the contact between H12 and ligands.

### Drug design based on H12 conformation change



## Mechanisms of Nuclear Receptor Signaling


### SKey Steps in Type I NRs Signaling
• Ligand binding
• Receptor dimerization
• nuclear translocation
• DNA binding
• Recruitment of co- regulators (coactivators and corepressors)

### Chaperones and Co-chaperones for Type I Receptors
- Stabilize the receptors, preventing degradation
- Maintain the proper conformation of the LBD to facilitate ligand binding.
- Play an important role in nuclear translocation of SRs

### Chaperones maintain the conformation of NRs for ligand-binding

### Transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane

NLS: nuclear localization signal; NES: nuclear export signal
LMB: leptomycin B, inhibitor of nuclear export

### Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of Type I Nuclear Receptors

- Type I NRs cannot diffuse through the nuclear pore complex due to their sizes (> 40 KDa)
- Nuclear translocation is a tightly regulated process.
- Depending on the receptor and physiological settings, the nuclear translocation of Type I NRs can be ligand-dependent or –independent.
- The active transport of NRs always dependents on the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLSs).

### NLSs of Type I Receptors NTD

• Bipartite structure: two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer
• The first cluster is in the DBD, the second in the hinge domain
• NLS activity is also found in the LBD and NTD

### Two-step Model for Type II Receptor Activation


### Nuclear Receptor Co-regulators

- Chaperones and co-chaperones: Hsp90, Hsp70
- Coactivators and corepressors
- Histone modifying enzymes: HATs, HDACs
- Recruiters of basal transcription machinery

### Histone Acetylation/deacetylation by Coregulators

### Nuclear Receptor Coactivators and Corepressors
Steroid Receptor Coactivator Family (SRC-1, 2, 3)
Not to be confused with Src kinase!

Corepressors:
Nuclear receptor CoRepressor (NCoR)
Silencing Mediator for Retinoid or Thyroid-hormone
receptors (SMRT)

### Complexity of Nuclear Receptors Signaling

- Genomic actions
	- Ligand-dependent, HRE-dependent
		"classical mechanism"
	- Ligand-dependent, HRE-independent
		"transcriptional crosstalk"
	- Ligand-independent
- Non-genomic actions
- Non-genomic to genomic signaling

### Nuclear Receptors Signaling: multiple modes

### NUCLEUSRapid effects of hormones

- Ca 2+ influx and PKC activation: progesterone, aldosterone, VitD3
- Vasodilation: estrogen

### Evidence for Non-genomic Actions of Nuclear Receptors

- These effects are too rapid (seconds to minutes) to be explained by transcription and protein synthesis
- These effects cannot be blocked by transcriptional inhibitors (actinomycin D) or protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide)
- These effects can be elicited by nuclear receptors that lack or have inactive transcriptional activation domains
- Some effects can be reproduced by using steroid hormones coupled to membrane- impermeable molecules.

### Membrane associated Nuclear Receptors
- classical NRs are associated with the membrane in the following manners:
	- tethered to the membrane by palmitoylation
		(ER, AR, PR)
 	- docked in membrane microdomains (caveolae or lipid rafts)
	- in close association with specific G-protein
couple receptors (GPCRs)

### Non-genomic Actions of Nuclear Receptors

- ERs have been found in caveolae and activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by phosphorylation

- Discovery of RXR: the Big Bang in NR research
- Sites of Androgen Receptor Action

### Androgen Receptor in Health and Disease

- Male Sex Development and Reproduction.
- Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). Caused by mutations in AR, leading to truncated receptor or altered ligand affinity. Symptoms are male sexual development is deterred or absent.
- Kennedy’s Disease. a.k.a. spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is caused by increased number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of AR. Affected individuals have progressive muscular weakness, cramps and witching in the limbs. Males have testicular atrophy, reduced fertility, and excessive development of the mammary glands. Females are usually carriers.

### Androgen Receptor in Health and Disease

- Cancer. Signaling through AR are critical for all stages of prostate cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanisms for AR activation in CRPC have been hot topics of investigation. Also play a role in cancers of the breast, liver, kidney, bladder
- Brain Development and Behavior. Widespread expression of AR is found in the mammalian brain, playing a role in brain development, e.g. white matter growth during adolescence, brain masculinization.
- Muscle Growth.
- Bone homeostasis and Osteoporosis.
- Immune Function. Maturation of B- and T- lymphocytes.
- Regulation of glucose metabolism and diabetes. Controls insulin secretion and sensitivity.

### Sites of Estrogen Receptor Action

### Estrogen Receptor in Health and Disease
- **Female Development and Reproduction**.
- **Skeletal Homeostasis and Osteoporosis**. ER regulates bone homeostasis in both male and female.
- **Breast Cancer**. Estrogen promotes the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) and aromatase inhibitors are used in the treatment of breast cancer.
- **Ovarian and Endometrial Cancer**.
- **Neuroprotective Effects**. Protection against neuro- degenerative diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease.
