## Culture tips

1. grow in room Tm (25 &deg;C); 60% relative humidity; (9-10 days from egg to adults)
2. With mold inhibitor, the generation time increases roughly 2 days.
3. old cultures produce less healthy flies and serve as a breading ground for mold and mites.
4. transfer flies ever 2 weeks and keep them maximum of 18 days.
5. Transferred without anesthetization:
    - tap the vial to make the flies stick on the cultures.
    - remove the plug and flip it over on a new vial.
    - tap the vial to make the flies to the new vial.
6. Place something to collect the fleet flies.
7. Too many flies cause soggy culture.



## Mutation Types

1. Dominant Nective:
    A mutation whose gene product adversely affects the normal, wild-type gene product within the same cell. This usually occurs if the product can still interact with the same elements as the wild-type product, but block some aspect of its function.[© genscript](https://www.genscript.com/biology-glossary/9431/dominant-negative#:~:text=A%20mutation%20whose%20gene%20product,some%20aspect%20of%20its%20function.)
    Examples:
    - A mutation in a transcription factor that removes the activation domain, but still contains the DNA binding domain. This product can then block the wild-type transcription factor from binding the DNA site leading to reduced levels of gene activation.
    - A protein that is functional as a dimer. A mutation that removes the functional domain, but retains the dimerization domain would cause a dominate negative phenotype, because some fraction of protein dimers would be missing one of the functional domains.
