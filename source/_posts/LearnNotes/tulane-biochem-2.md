## Overview

### Protein Structure
> - Proteins are **polymers** of amino acids
> - Native proteins are folded into a unique **three dimensional structure**
> - The three dimensional structure is responsible for specificity and **biological activity**
> - The structure is determined entirely by the **primary sequence** of amino acids through the physical & chemical properties of the amino acids

### Amino Acid Properties

> - Chemical Structure
> - R group is variable
> - 20 amino acids are found in proteins

> - Amino acids are **chiral** (optically active)
> - Amino acids in proteins always have the **L configuration** (Equivalent to the configuration of glyceraldehyde that rotates polarized light to the left)
> - **Levorotatory** – Leftward rotation of light
> - **Dextrorotatory** – Rightward rotation
> - L amino acids are **not** all Levorotatory

### 20 AA

## Ionization Properties of Amino Acids
| AA  | Function Group | pKa |
| :-: | :- | :-|
| Asp | -CH~2~-COO^-^| 3.9 |
| Glu | -CH~2~-CH~2~-COO^-^ | 4.3 |

| His | -CH~2~-Imidazole| 6.5





## primary structure

1. Direction: N -> C
2. Average molecule weight of per amino acid is ~110.

### Properties of the Peptide Bond

*[resonance]: 共振
*[planar]: 平面
*[Coplanarity]: 共面性

> - Electronic resonance gives the central -C(=O)N(H)- atoms some ==double-bond character==
> - Double bond character gives these bonds a generally ==planar== (not tetrahedral) shape and rigidity
> - ==Coplanarity== severely limits the number of accessible conformations

### Cis-trans isomerization

> - Trans peptide bonds are energetically preferred
> - Cis peptide bonds are rare:
>   - 0.05% of all non-proline peptide bonds are cis
>   - 6.5 % of all X-Pro peptide bonds are cis
> - Rate of conversion between cis and trans is slow

Trans: opposite
Cis: same side

### Conformational Properties of Polypeptides

*[torsion]: 扭轉
*[Steric clashes]: 立体衝突

> - Protein backbone conformation can be described with 2 torsion angles Phi (&Phi;) and Psi (&Psi;) around Cα
> - Steric clashes make only some combinations of &Phi; and &Psi; permissible
> - The requirement for hydrogen bonding between backbone groups in folded proteins further limits the observed values for &Phi; and &Psi;

## Secondary Structure of Polypeptides

> - **Hydrogen Bonds** are weak noncovalent interactions between polar groups.
> - In a folded protein, **backbone groups** are always involved in hydrogen bonds.
> - Hydrogen bonding along with the allowed &phi; , &psi; torsion angles determine the possible types of secondary structure


> - Secondary structure is the local conformation the backbone
> - Secondary structure is defined by Hydrogen bonding patterns and &Phi; , &Psi; torsion angles


### &alpha; helix

| ![Hemoglobin A2](https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/structures/si/1si4/1si4_assembly-1.jpeg) |
| :-------------: |
| [© PDB ID=1SI4](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1SI4)     |

> - Right handed helix
> - Interactions are local
> - Defined by Hydrogen-bonding pattern (ith) C=0 - - - NH (i+4)th
> - Accounts for well more than half of all protein structure
> - Pitch: 3.6 residues per turn
> - Rise: 1.5 Å per residue (5.4Å/turn)
> - 13 atoms in the hydrogen bonded loop
>
> Hemoglobin - an all α helical protein

#### Close packing in an α-helix

*[propensities]: 傾向

> - Helices are very **tightly packed** structures
> - The C=O::HN hydrogen bonds are **partially buried** within the core of the helical structure
> - Because of steric constraints and hydrophobic interactions between side chains, the amino acids have very different propensities for being in an α-helix.


### The β-pleated sheet

| :-------------: |
| [© PDB ID=2QLE](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2QLE)     |


> - Chains are extended
> - Interactions are nonlocal
> - Can be parallel or antiparallel
> - Antiparallel is preferred
> - Can contain from 2 to 25+ strands
> - Accounts for most non-helical protein structure
>- Length: 3.3 Å per residue
>
> Influenza Neuraminidase an all β-sheet protein

### Reverse Turn
> - Short 180º turn of ~ 4 residues
> - Connects elements of secondary structure
> - Interactions are local
> - Often occur at surface of protein
> - Many types are defined by hydrogen-bonding patterns
>
> The hairpin motif

### others

> **3-10 helix**
> - Uncommon right-handed helix
> - Hydrogen-bonding pattern:
>   C=0 (i) - - - NH (i+3)
> - Often found at the ends of α-helices
>
> **π helix**
> - Rare right-handed helix
> - Hydrogen-bonding pattern:
>   C=0 (i)- - - NH (i+5)
>
> **Ω loop**
> - Found at the surfaces of proteins
> - Base of loop is part of a proteins secondary structure, while the loop is disordered as in the letter omega (Ω )
>
> **Random coil**
> - No regular secondary structure
> - Highly flexible
