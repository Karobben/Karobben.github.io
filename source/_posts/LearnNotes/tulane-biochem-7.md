>     Energy storage metabolite
>     Building block of other lipids
> - Triacylglycerols (fat)
>     - Energy storage
> - Glycerophospholipids

## Fatty Acids - structure and nomenclature

> Fatty acid rules of nomenclature
> - Carbon numbering start at carboxyl carbon
> - Double bonds are numbered at the first carbon
> - cis configuration is normal (trans is specified)
>
> Syntax for nomenclature
> length:#double bonds (list of double bond locations)
>
> 16:0 = palmitic acid
> 18:1(9) = oleic acid (sometimes written 18:1(Δ9))
> 20:4(5,8,11,14) = arachidonic acid

> Typical eukaryotic fatty acid structure
> - Even number of carbons
> - Non-conjugated double bonds (double bonds are separated by at least one CH2)
> Double bonds are normally cis If a double
> bond is trans it is specified in the name

PS:
**Even number**: Synthesis and degraded of the fatty acid are occur two carbons at a time.
**Conjugated double bounds**: Conjugated double bounds could make fluorescence. Exp: Retinol, or vitamin A, has five conjugated double bonds and absorbs the violet part of the spectrum, thus appearing as yellow.[^color]
**Cis**: As the picture above, the hydrogen atoms are on the same side.

## Classes of diacyl lipids

The two backbone molecules in diacyl lipids:
- Glycerol (Glycerophospholipids)
- Serine (Sphingolipids)

> Diacyl lipids are the main structural component of bilayers and are the ==ONLY component that will form bilayers in pure form==.

==Be able to draw the base of this two lipids.==

A signaling molecule

**Phosphatidic acid**: is rare in memebrane but it's intermediate of the metabolic.
**Phosphatidylcholine**: Most abundant glycerophospholipid found in eukaryotic membrane. Innert, not strong interaction with others. (Outside of the membrane)
**Phosphatidylethanolamine**: Charge and much activity than Phosphatidylcholine, inside the cell.
**Phosphatidylglycerol**: also abundant in prokaryotic cell.
**Phosphatidylserine**: active, inside the cell. Common in eukaryotic cell. It's not a sugar group, it is a sample carbon base ring.
**Phosphatidylinositol**: Negative Charged, signaling molecule. Second messenger.

## Sphingolipid Headgroups

## Fatty acid melting points

The longer the chain, the higher the melting point.
The more double bounds, the lower the melting point.

## Phospholipases and cyclooxygenases

Phospholipases A~1~, ==A~2~==, B, C, and D.
Most phospholipids was cleaved by Phospholipase A~2~

**cyclooxygenases**

|![cyclooxygenases](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fgb-2004-5-9-241/MediaObjects/13059_2004_Article_756_Fig3_HTML.jpg?as=webp)|

|[© NV Chandrasekharan](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-241)|

Cyclooxygenases (COXs) catalyze the rate-limiting step in the production of ==prostaglandins==, which is an signal molecule and both ==soluble in water and lipids==.

## Cholesterol and other steroids

|![Cholesterol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=5997&width=300&height=300)|
|:-:|
|[&copy; PubChem ID= 5997](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)|

> - Cholesterol is a component of biological membranes
> - Up to 50% of a membrane’s lipid can be cholesterol
> - It ==rigidifies or stiffens== bilayers
> - Cholesterol is converted to bile acids (used in digestion) and steroid hormones (used for signaling)
> - Steroid hormones freely cross membranes and act directly on nuclear receptors

*[RBC]: Red blood cell

The hydroxyl group of the cholesterol makes it float on the cell membrane.
In the RBC, the cholesterol in cytomembrane could up to 50% and which makes the membrane very rigidity. (try to keep it's shape when it through the catepillars) Lake of most membrane proteins. As a contrast, the mitochondria's membrane does not have cholesterol and has very high fluidity which needs to go constant conformation change. One of the fluidity membrane we know are rod and cone cell which are light recept cells. They need to interact quickly. As a result, they are made highly portion of the saturated fatty acids and very little of cholesterol.


|Steroid Hormones|&copy; PubChem|
|:-:|:-:|
|![Cortisol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=5754&width=300&height=300)|![Testosterone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=6013&width=300&height=300)|
|![Aldosterone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=5839&width=300&height=300)|![&Beta;-Estradiol](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=5757&width=300&height=300)|

These hormones are both soluble in water and lipids. So they can pass membrane easily.

## Polymorphic Phase Behavior of Lipids

> - All lipids spontaneously separate from water
> - The form of the lipid phase depends on the molecular "shape" of the molecule

### Head group end

Molecular shap hypothesis:

| Lipid Type    | Composition     |Types in below|
| :------------- | :------------- |-:|
| Fatty acid Other detergents | micelle |Type 1|
| Diacyl Lipid | bilayer|Type 0|
| Diacyl Glycerol| inverse micelle|Type 2|

Core of the membrane is the most hydrophobic environment we can find.
In the core of folded protein, the hydrophobic core coudl have a few polar groups. But not poler group in Membrane core. Which gaves the membrane a ==barrier property==

> Living cells actively maintain a certain membrane fluidity by adjusting the composition of the lipids in their membranes.

The lipids are the solvents, the proteins are solutes.
This drawing is ==wrong==. The membrane can pack more protein than it. Exp: Mitochondria.

> Membrane-spanning proteins have very few polar groups groups, such as the peptide back bone exposed to the core of the bilayer.


| Membrane Protein||
| :------------- | :------------- |
|α-helix|<blockquote><li>19-25 residues to span the membrane<li>Self hydrogen-bonding<li>Mostly hydrophobic along the membrane-spanning segment<li>About 25% of ALL proteins are helical membrane proteins</blockquote>|
|β-barrel|<blockquote><li>8-12 residues are required to span membrane<li>Not self Hydrogen bonding<li>Dyad repeat motif (alternating hydrophobic/hydrophilic)<li>Found in the outer membranes of some bacteria and in mitochondria</blockquote>|

Membrane integral protein challenges:
  - Residues: Hydrophobic residues on the menbrane core area
  - Carbon back-bond: Form hydrogen bond with itself.

Typically, the surface of the proteins interacted with membrane are even more hydroponically than the core of folded protein.

30Å membrane core takes about 20 residues of &alpha;-helix.
β-barrel only find in gram-negative bacterial, mitochondrial and chloroplasts. (Human, about 50 β-barrel gene and only on mitochondria genome. 2% of gene is β-barrel in E. coli)
