## General information

### Type of membrane transport depends on:

> - Characteristics of the substance being transported
> - Direction of transport

### Three main classes of membrane protein

> 1. ==ATP-power pump== (carrier, permease) couple with **energy source** for active transport binding of specific solute to transporter which undergo conformation change.
> 2. ==Channel protein== (ion channel) formation of **hydrophilic** allow passive movement of small inorganic molecule.
> 3. ==Transporters==:
>    - uniport (single)
>    - Symport (double)
>    - antiport (double & anti one cis another trans gradient)

### Two types of transport:

> 1. Passive transport (diffusion): ==NO metabolic energy is needed==
> 2. Active Transport: ==Metabolic energy is used==

### Passive (simple) diffusion

> - **Small noncharged molecules** or **lipid soluble molecules** pass between the phospholipids to enter or leave the cell
> - Moving from areas of **high concentration** to areas of **low concentration** (they move down their concentration gradient)
> - **Example**: Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and most lipids

### Osmosis

> A type of simple diffusion in which water molecules diffuse through a selectively permeable membrane from areas of high water concentration to areas of lower water concentration.

### Facilitated diffusion

> - The substance is moving **down its concentration gradient** through a **membrane protein** (not between the phospholipids)
> - **Example**: monosaccharide, glucose, ==water==
>   - “Water & oil don’t mix”
    - That’s why water was not considered as passive diffusion
    - Aquaporins increase water permeability
    - Too much mRNA injected into Frog Oocyte could make it absorbing too much water.

|![Aquaporins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susanna-Toernroth-Horsefield/publication/23235554/figure/fig2/AS:667685440479244@1536200022868/Overview-of-human-aquaporin-5-A-Top-view-of-the-tetramer-from-the-cytoplasm-along-the.png)|

### GLUT1 Mechanism (Facilitated Diffusion)


|![GLUT1 Working Model](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yan-Chuangye/publication/262532522/figure/fig5/AS:267787981553664@1440857038049/A-working-model-for-GLUT1-Shown-here-are-the-predicted-conformations-outward-open.png)|
|:-:|
|[&copy; Dong Deng, et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262532522_Crystal_structure_of_the_human_glucose_transporter_GLUT1)|


> - most commonly expressed glucose transporter
> - reversible (depends on concentration gradient); glucose is commonly rapidly phosphorylated in cytoplasm
> - ping pong mechanism (protein does not “flip”)

### Facilitated vs. Passive Diffusion

|[&copy; Florina Silvia Iliescu, et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269702922_A_PARALLEL_BETWEEN_TRANSDERMAL_DRUG_DELIVERY_AND_MICROTECHNOLOGY)|

Exp: GLUT1 (erythrocytes) and GLUT2 (liver & pancreas)

- saturable
- non-linear
- selective, fast & constant rate at 5-10 mM
- uptake rate varies more (stimulates insulin release)

### Active transport

PS: Energy; Against Concentration

> - Move substances across membranes **against their concentration gradient** (from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration)
> - **Energy** is needed for this movement

### Primary vs Secondary active transport

|![Primary vs Secondary active transport](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alberto-Canarini/publication/331257253/figure/fig1/AS:728743127568394@1550757309754/Summary-of-the-main-exudation-mechanisms-through-the-plasmamembrane-at-the-root-tip.ppm)|

- Primary: simply against the concentration
- Secondary: send the intermediate molecule against the concentration and then, Symport the target molecules against the concentration.

> e.g.:
> - Intestinal & Kidney
>  Utilize the free-energy for Na (down its concentration gradient) to move glucose (against its concentration gradient)
> - SGLT-2 (Na-glucose co-transporter 2)

>
> Synapse:

## ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) Superfamily

>   - Bacterial plasma membrane (AA, sugar, and peptide transporters)

### ABC Transporters & Presystemic Clearance

> Mechanism of presystemic clearance. After drug enters the enterocyte, it can undergo metabolism, excretion into the intestinal lumen, or transport into the portal vein. Similarly, the hepatocyte may accomplish metabolism and biliary excretion prior to the entry of drug and metabolites to the systemic circulation.
