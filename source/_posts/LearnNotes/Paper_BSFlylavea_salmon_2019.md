## Black soldier fly larvae meal can replace fish meal in diets of sea-water phase Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)

## Abstract
- black soldier fly larvae (insect meal) replacing to fish meal
-  did not affect the apparent digestibility coefficients
(ADC) of protein, lipid, amino acids and fatty acids, or the digestive enzyme activities
- Feed intake, daily growth increase, and feed conversion ratio were also unaffected
- Whole body protein, lipid and amino acid composition were not affected
- Liver lipid accumulation was not affected by replacing the fishmeal with insect meal

## Discussion

**Sea-Water Phase Atlantic Salmon**
- no negatively affect feed intake
- growth performance
- nutrient utilization

Similarly results in diet Substituted on blackspot sea bream (Lates calcarifer):
- yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor)
- housefly maggot (Musca domestica)

**However**, **reduced growth** and feed **utilization** has been reported in **juvenile turbot** and **rainbow trout** (Author: Caused by chitin?)
(chitin can decrease the FA synthesis and to increase TAG hydrolysis in rat liver)

Salmonids fed diets containing BSF larvae raised on fish offal or seaweeds grew better than fish fed dietary BSF larvae raised without marine nutrients.

Low level of lysine in the insect-based diet had no effect on **European seabass**.

low level of taurine may effact the lipid deposition of the liver but we didn't detected it. (hepatosomatic index)
