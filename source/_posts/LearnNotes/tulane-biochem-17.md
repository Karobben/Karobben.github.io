- acK: acetyl lysine
- meR: methyl arginine
- meK: methyl lysine
- PS: phosphoryl serine
- uK: ubiquitinated lysine

### Histone Code

“Specific modifications of histones evoke certain chromatin-based functions, and these modifications act sequentially or in combination to generate unique biological outcomes.”

Wikipedia -- Gene transcription is regulated by chemical modification to histone proteins.

### Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs)

HATs acetylase histone lysine side chains.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues in histones. Zinc is involved (not shown)

The enzyme is deeply clefted.
The histone H3 peptide KSTGGK14APRKQ (yellow) and coenzyme A (pink) are bound at the deep cleft.

Catalysis appears to involve water-mediated proton extraction from the substrate lysine by a glutamic acid general base.

### Acetylated Lys Recognition by Bromodomains

- Bromodomains specifically bind acetylated lysine residues on histones.
- Structure of double bromodomain of human TAF1, a subunit of transcription factor TFIID (PDB code 1eqf)
- Two binding sites are separated by ~25Å, ideal for two acetyl-Lys residues separated by 7-8 residues.
- Histone H4 has Lys at positions 5, 8, 12, 16
- Fully acetylated H4 binds tighter to double than single bromodomains (5/12 or 8/16 pairs).


### Role of TAF1 Double Bromodomain


- TAF1 double bromodomain targets TFIID to promoters
- A refined proposal for transcription initiation
	1. A HAT-containing coactivator binds to upstream DNA- binding protein (an activator)
	2. The HAT acetylates nearby histone tails
	3. TFIID is recruited to the site via the binding of the TAF1 double bromodomain to the acetyl-Lys residues of histones.
	4. Followed by recruitment of other initiation factors and RNAP-II for transcription initiation.


### Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)

18 HDAC enzymes that deacetylate acetyl lysine substrates including histones.
- Histone deacetylase family (zinc-dependent)
- Sirtuin family (NAD-dependent)

Reaction mechanism:
- Bound Zn mediates the nucleophilic attack of water on acetylated lysine, forming a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate.
- The carbon–nitrogen bond of the intermediate is then broken and the nitrogen accepts a proton from His-Asp.
- The acetate and lysine products are formed.

### Sirtuins

|![Sirtuins](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124115965000034-f03-01-9780124115965.jpg)|
|:-:|
|[© William Giblin, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124115965000034)|

NAD^+^-dependent reaction
1. Nucleophilic addition to form a C1′- O-alkylamidate intermediate and free nicotinamide.
2. The 2′-hydroxy group of the NAD+ ribose attacks the C1′-O- alkylamidate to form the 1′,2′-cyclic intermediate.
3. The formation of deacetylated lysine and 2′-O-acetyl-ADP ribose.

Thus, nicotinamide, a deacetylated lysine-containing histone, and 2′- O-acetyl-ADP ribose are the final reaction products.

### Histone Methylation
- Methylation at Lys and Arg of H3 and H4 tends to silence the genes, inducing heterochromatin formation
- However, trimethylated Lys4 of H3 is associated with active genes!!!

- Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) use S- adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor
- The HMT enzymes have a SET domain containing the catalytic site for methylation.


### Structure of SET7/9 (PDB code 1o9s)

|![SET7/9](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/fda249efe5a9e467c8d401edc6831552225660f8/2-Figure1-1.png)|

- SET7/9 mono-methylates Lys4 of H3.
- SAM (SAH) and the Lys4-containing peptide bind to opposite sites of the protein.
- The Lys4 side chain is inserted through a narrow channel and positioned for methylation by SAM.


### Methylated Histone Recognition

|[© Kuo, 2012](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dinshaw-patel/histone-epigenetic-code)|

- Chromodomains and plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers bind to mono-, di- or tri-methylated Lys by an aromatic cage.

Extral Reading: [Epigenetic Regulation Mediated by Histone Marks](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dinshaw-patel/histone-epigenetic-code)

### Consequence of Methylated Histone Recognition

• The chromodomain of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) binds to methylated H3 Lys9, contributing to gene silencing.
• Bound HP1 recruits the HMT Suv39h, methylating nearby histone lysines (H3K9), thereby recruiting more HP1 and forming HP1
complexes.
• This mechanism explains how heterochromatin spread to silence neighboring genes.

### Histone Demethylases

|![Histone Demethylases](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrm3327/MediaObjects/41580_2012_Article_BFnrm3327_Fig1_HTML.jpg)|

|:-:|
|[© Sang-AhKim, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276520302616)|

The LSD1 is bound to a 21 amino acid H3 peptide with a mutation of Lys4 to Met (green).
Modeling predicts that methylated Lys4 binds in a solvent inaccessible area in front of the FAD cofactor (electron extraction).

### Understanding the demethylation reaction from the JMJD3 Structure

|![JMJD3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1093326316301747-fx1_lrg.jpg)|
|:-:|
|[© SanchariBasu Mallik, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1093326316301747)|
- The JMJD3 is bound to a H3 peptide with a trimethylated Lys27 (yellow).
- The cofactor analog N-oxalylglycine NOG (not α-ketoglutarate) and nickel (not iron) are used to prevent the reaction.

The methylated Lys27 side chain inserts deep into the catalytic pocket, close to the cofactor analog (pink) and nickel (green) for demethylation reaction.

### Biological advantages of DNA

1. Provides stable, yet mutable storage of genetic information. Metabolic stability and availability of repair mechanisms ensure long-term survival under a variety of physiological conditions.
2. Serves as a template for accurate and adaptable replication of genomes. This biological role ensures the transmission of important physiological functions for multiple generations.
3. Serves as a template for the expression and regulation of genetic information. This biological role facilitates adaptation of genomes to changing physiological environments.
4. Amenable to diversification (i.e., can evolve). Mutation and genetic recombination (DNA rearrangements) are the two major driving forces in the evolution of genomic diversity and adaptation in nature.

4. Non-homologous DNA end-joining (), specific proteins that repair dsDNA breaks


### Homologous reconbination
- Required for accurate chomosome segregation
- repairing and tolerating DNA damage
- Recovery of stalled or broken replication forks
- Defects in recombination can contribute to genome instability and cancer predispositions

### Biological roles
1. Genetic reassortments in gametogenesis
2. Repair of DNA damages
3.  Repair replication forks
4. laterl DNA transfer between ceels
5. therOther, deletions, inversions, translocations, etc.

### How HR produces deletions, insertions and inversions

1. Incersion:
  DNA fold in a revised direction, The DNA form a arch bridge and at the foot of the bridge connected
2. Deletion and insertion
  DNA fold in a same direction. A circle formed and the cross point was connected together and the circle was deleted. (Insertion happens the similar way.)

### Translocation that casue cancers
1. Chronic myeloid leukemia
BCR/ABL mRNA
p210 fusion protein

ABL are concertive hyregulated RTK, BRC is a higly active promoter which drive the high expression of the ABL which resbonsible to growth and differentiation.

### Holliday Model of Recombination

Nicking  → Strand Exchange → Branch Migration → Resoltion → Recombination molecules


### SOS response: Mutagenic Survival Pathway of Last Resort
1. DNA Damges → ssDNA or dsDNA break → No Transcription
  Normal LaxA turning of LexA-Regulated gene
2. Auto-cleavage of LaxA recruitment lots of RecA.

RacA: Pre-synapsis → Synapsis → ppost-synapsis
RacA complex driving homology search and alignment of complementary sequences.


### Site-specific reconbination: intergration of lambda phage DNA into the E.coli Chromosome
