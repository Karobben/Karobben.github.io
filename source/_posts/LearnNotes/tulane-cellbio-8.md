## 14.1 Studying the Secretory Pathway
- **Various labels** enable tracking protein movement through the secretory pathway to different destinations.
- **Components required** for intracellular protein trafficking have been identified by analysis of yeast temperature-sensitive secretory (sec) mutants.
- **Cell-free assays** for intercompartmental protein transport have defined individual steps of the secretory pathway.

### Protein Transport through the Secretory Pathway

- GFP labeled viral membrane glycoproteins synthesized and transported to host cell membrane by the constitutive secretory pathway.
- Looked at time points to determine cell location.
- At 0 time point, VSV G-GFP retained in ER.
- At 40 min, most concentrated in the Golgi.
- At 180 min, most VSV G-GFP has integrated into and is diffusing within the plasma membrane.

### Secretory and Endocytic Pathways

- Transport vesicles transport membrane and soluble proteins from one membrane-bound compartment to another.
- Transport vesicles collect cargo proteins in membrane budding from a donor compartment and deliver cargo by fusing with a target membrane.
- Secretory pathway distributes cargo proteins to final destinations (ER, Golgi, cell surface (including secretion) or lysosomes.
- Cargo buds from the ER, fuse together to form a new cis-Golgi cisternae → move by nonvesicular cisteral maturation, and retrograde vesicle transport.
- Regulated (aggregates) and constitutive secretion.
- Lysosomal proteins bud and fuse with late endosome.
- Endocytic vesicles bud from plasma membrane, delivered to lysosomes via late endosomes.

### Sec Mutants Identify 5 Stages of Secretory Pathway

|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p637](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Yeast temperature-sensitive mutants define 5 major stages and individual components involved in targeting and vesicular transport: Cytosol, Rough ER, Vesicles transporting proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex, Golgi cisternae, and constitutive secretory vesicles
- Mutations simultaneously in both class B and class D functions: proteins accumulate in rough ER, not in Golgi → defines order of steps


### ER to Golgi Transport and Processing

|![ER to Golgi Transport and Processing](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5U3lYn.png)|

|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p636](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Yeast temperature-sensitive mutant: At 40°C is retained in ER, not processed in Golgi. At 32°C, transported to Golgi and processed.
- Shows that processing of glycosylation occurs in Golgi.


EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 14-3 **Transport of a membrane glycoprotein from the ER to the Golgi can be assayed based on sensitivity to cleavage by endoglycosidase D.**
- Detecting secretory protein carbohydrate modifications by compartment-specific enzymes elucidates trafficking through different compartments.

Experiment:
-   Temperature-sensitive VSV G protein – labeled with a pulse of radioactive amino acid during synthesis in cells
- Split cells into two groups –
  - Group 1 – Control cells maintained at 40°C – misfolded protein retained in ER
  - Group 2 – Experimental cells shifted to 32°C – protein moves through secretory pathway
  - Time points – VSV G protein extracted and treated with endoglycosidase D
- (a) Protein movement to cis-Golgi and modification:
  - Protein retained in the ER – not modified
  - Protein moved from the ER to the cis-Golgi – core oligosaccharide Man8(GlcNAc)2 is trimmed to Man5(GlcNAc)2 by cis-Golgi resident enzymes
  - Endoglycosidase D – cleaves the oligosaccharide chains from proteins processed in the cis-Golgi, but not from proteins retained in the ER
- (b) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the digestion mixtures (Autoradiography only shows labeled VSV G protein in gel.):
  - (ER) resistant – uncleaved (larger-slower-migrating)
  - (cis-Golgi) sensitive  – cleaved (smaller-faster-migrating)
  - 5 min – most protein resistant to EndoD cleavage – not yet moved from ER to cis-Golgi ER
  - 60 min – most protein cleaved by EndoD cleavage – moved to and modified in the cis-Golgi
- (c) Percentage of EndoD-sensitive VSV G protein over time:
  - Derived from electrophoretic data
  - 40°C – little increase n sensitive protein – misfolded proteins retained in ER
  - 32°C – most protein moved from ER to cis-Golgi and modified by 30–40 min


### Protein Transport from One Golgi Cisternae to Another

|![Golgi Cisternae to Another](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5U3jts.png)|

|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p637](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Mutant in cis-Golgi. Cannot process from High mannose glycosylation.
- Wild type processes glycosylation in each of the Golgi cisternae.
- Mixing of Golgi shows cis-Golgi enzyme (N-acetylglucosamine transferase) moved from wild type medial Golgi to mutant cis-Golgi by retrograde vesicle transport during cisteral maturation process.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 14-5 A cell-free assay demonstrates protein transport from one Golgi cisterna to another.
- Cell-free transport assays – biochemical dissection of secretory pathway individual steps
Experiment:
- VSV virus infection of cultured mutant cells lacking one of the Golgi enzymes that modify N-linked oligosaccharide chains –fate of the VSV G protein.
- (a) VSV G protein modification in Golgi of intact wild-type and mutant fibroblast cells
  - Wild-type cells:
    - medial-Golgi – N-acetylglucosamine transferase I adds one N-acetylglucosamine to N-linked oligosaccharides
    - trans-Golgi – N-linked oligosaccharides further modified to more complex carbohydrate
  - Mutant cells – lack medial-Golgi N-acetylglucosamine transferase I:
    - medial-Golgi – no addition of N-acetylglucosamine
    - trans-Golgi – no further modification to complex carbohydrate
    - G protein reaches the cell surface with a simpler high-mannose oligosaccharide containing only two N-acetylglucosamine and five mannose residues.
- (b) Golgi isolated from VSV-infected mutant cells and noninfected wild-type cells:
  - Mutant cell Golgi – contains VSV G protein
  - Wild-type cell Golgi – no VSV G protein
  - Golgi mixed together
- Result: Some VSV G protein modified by wild-type medial-Golgi N-acetylglucosamine transferase I
- Conclusion: N-acetylglucosamine transferase I – moved by transport vesicles from the wild-type medial-Golgi cisternae to the mutant cis-Golgi during cisternal maturation process.


## 14.2 Molecular Mechanisms of Vesicle Budding and Fusion

- Three types of coated vesicles mediate protein transport through different pathways.
- Small GTPase proteins direct coat protein polymerization on donor membranes to pinch off vesicles carrying different cargoes.
- Coat shedding exposes Rab and SNARE proteins that target vesicles for fusion with specific target membranes.


### Vesicle Budding and Fusion with a Target Membrane

|![Vesicle Budding and Fusion](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UG6de.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p640](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|


- Coat proteins bind membrane cargo cytosolic domain.
- Soluble cargo bind receptors, receptor also binds coat protein.
- Vesicle SNARES (v-SNARES) captured in budding vesicle.
- Coat evaginates donor membrane, pinches off coated vesicle.
- Monomeric GTP-binding protein also binds coat protein in GTPbound form. GTP hydrolysis → decoating. G protein also leaves.
- Decoating uncovers v-SNARES, interaction with target membrane t-SNARES for membrane fusion.

### Coated Vesicles Involved in Protein Trafficking

- Three major types of transport vesicles: each with a different type of protein coat and monomeric GTPase protein.

|Vesicle Type | Transport Step Mediated | Coat Proteins | Associated GTPase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|COPII | ER to cis-Golgi | Sec23/Sec24 and Sec13/Sec31, Sec16 | Sar1|
|COPI |cis-Golgi to ER Later to earlier Golgi cisternae | Coatomers containing seven different COP subunits| ARF|
| Clathrin and adapter proteins*| trans-Golgi to endosome | Clathrin + AP1 complexes |ARF |
|| trans-Golgi to endosome | Clathrin + GGA  | ARF|
| | Plasma membrane to endosome  | Clathrin + AP2 complexes |ARF|
||Golgi to lysosome, melanosome, or platelet vesicles|  AP3 complexes |ARF|

### Sar1 Role Assembly/Disassembly of COPII Coat

|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p641](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|


- 1. GEF function: Sar1-GDP → Sar1-GTP, membrane bound.
- 2. Sar1-GTP recruits coat proteins, curvature forms bud w/ cargo.
- 3. GTP hydrolysis, Sar1-GDP loses affinity for vesicle membrane.
- 4. Sar1-GDP not membrane bound, promotes coat disassembly.
- Image: Coated vesicles accumulate during in vitro budding in presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analog.

### Docking/Fusion of Vesicle w/Target Membrane

|![Docking/Fusion](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UY6Cd.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p643](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

1. Vesicle Rab binds Rab effector on target membrane.
2. v-SNARE forms stable coiled-coil interaction with t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25); hold vesicle close to target membrane.
3. Fusion of two membrane → drives dissociation of the SNARE complexes (4), freeing SNARE proteins (recycled by NSF – an AAA-family member).

- Not shown: Rab-GTP hydrolyzed to RabGDP – dissociates Rab from the Rab effector.


### Targeting Sequences on Cytosolic Regions of Cargo Proteins Bind to Specific Coat Proteins

|Signal Sequence* |Signal-Bearing Protein | Proteins with Signal | Vesicles That Incorporate Signal Receptor|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LUMINAL SORTING SIGNALS|
|Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) |ER-resident soluble proteins |KDEL receptor in cis-Golgi membrane| COPI|
|Mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)| Soluble lysosomal enzymes after processing in cis-Golgi| M6P receptor in trans-Golgi membrane| Clathrin/AP1|
|CYTOPLASMIC SORTING SIGNALS|
|Lys-Lys-X-X (KKXX) |ER-resident membrane proteins| COPI α and β subunits |COPI|
|Asn-Pro-X-Tyr (NPXY)| LDL receptor in plasma membrane |AP2 complex |Clathrin/AP2|


## 14.3 Early Stages of the Secretory Pathway

- COPII-coated vesicles transport newly synthesized proteins containing Golgi-targeting sequences in their cytosolic domain or bound to such proteins from the rough ER to the cis-Golgi (anterograde direction).
- COPI-coated vesicles transport vesicles carrying ER/Golgi-resident proteins in the retrograde direction, which supports Golgi cisternal maturation.

### Vesicle-Mediated ER and cis-Golgi Trafficking

|![Vesicle-Mediated ER and cis-Golgi Trafficking](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UN8p9.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p644](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|


Forward (anterograde) transport: COPII vesicles ER → cis-Golgi transport.
- Step 1: COPII coat assembles.
- Step 2: COPII coat disassembly.
- Step 3: Membrane fusion
Reverse (retrograde) transport: COPI
vesicle cis-Golgi to ER transport.
- Cargo: recycles membrane bilayer, v-SNAREs, and missorted ERresident proteins.
- Step 4: COPI coat assembles.
- Step 5: COPI coat disassembly.
- Step 6: Membrane fusion.

### KDEL Receptor Retrieval of ER-Resident Luminal Proteins from the Golgi

|![KDEL Receptor Retrieval](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UUFHK.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p647](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Soluble ER proteins contain KDEL (LysAsp-Glu-Leu) ER-targeting sequence. May become missorted to cis-Golgi: Nonspecifically incorporated into COPII vesicle fluid phase.
- cis-Golgi to ER retrieval mechanism: cis-Golgi acidic pH promotes receptorKDEL interactions.
- Higher pH of ER → dissociates ER resident KDEL protein from the KDEL receptor. Retrieval system prevents depletion of ER luminal proteins.

### Processing of N-linked Oligosaccharide within cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi Cisternae


|![trans-Golgi Cisternae](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UUXrt.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p648](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

trans-Golgi:
- N-acetylneuraminic acids added (7).
- Galactoses added (6).
medial-Golgi:
- Fucose added (5).
- Mannoses removed (3).
- N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc) added (2 and 4).
cis-Golgi:
- Mannoses removed (1).
Anterograde transport occurs by cisternal maturation.
- Golgi cisternae have different enzymes.

## 14.4 Later Stages of the Secretory Pathway

- The trans-Golgi network sorts proteins into vesicles targeted for different destinations.
- Lysosomal enzymes bear M6P residues that are recognized by M6P-receptors and delivered by a clathrin-coated vesicle pathway to lysosomes.
- Regulated secretory proteins are concentrated and stored until secretion is signaled; constitutively secreted proteins are continuously delivered to the plasma membrane.
- Some proteins are processed into mature form after leaving the trans-Golgi network.

### Vesicle Trafficking from trans-Golgi Network

|![ Vesicle Trafficking](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UaDsI.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p651](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- (5) Regulated secretory vesicles (unknown coat).
- (4) Constitutive secretory vesicles (unknown coat).
- (3) Clathrin-coated (+AP2) vesicles transport to late endosomes.
- (2) AP complex vesicles transport directly to lysosomes.
- (1) COPI vesicles: retrograde to trans-Golgi (cisternal progression).
- Distal sorting trans-Golgi network: transport vesicles to plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes.

### Dynamin Pinching Off of Clathrin-Coated Vesicles

|![ Dynamin Pinching Off of Clathrin-Coated Vesicles](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UdltS.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p652](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Dynamin:
  - Required for pinching off of clathrin-coated vesicles
  - Polymerizes around vesicle neck
  - Hydrolyzes GTP – conformational change coupled to membrane fusion and vesicle release from the donor membrane.
- GTP hydrolysis by dynamin is required for the pinching off of clathrin-coated vesicles (cells incubated with GTP-γ-S nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP).


### Formation of Mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) to Target Soluble Enzymes to Lysosomes

|![ Dynamin Pinching Off of Clathrin-Coated Vesicles](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5UwrUf.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p653](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

M6P signal directs newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes.
- Step 1: cis-Golgi-localized N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) phosphotransferase transfers a phosphorylated GlcNAc group to carbon 6 of one or more mannose residues.
- Step 2: Phosphodiesterase removes the GlcNAc group, leaving a 6-phosphorylated mannose residue on the lysosomal enzyme.

### Trafficking of Lysosomal Enzymes from trans-Golgi Network and Cell Surface to Lysosomes

|![Trafficking of Lysosomal Enzymes](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5Uw5V0.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p654](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- M6P receptors in trans-Golgi membrane recruit M6P-lysosomal enzymes into clathrin/AP1-coated vesicles (1).
- Clathrin coat disassembles (2). Coat proteins recycled (2a).
- Vesicle fuses with late endosome compartment (3). Acidic pH dissociates M6P-enzyme from receptor.
- Late endosome fuses with a lysosome (4). M6P receptors recycled (4a).
- Some receptors are delivered to the cell surface (5a). Plasma membrane M6P receptors (5) capture missorted M6P-enzymes into clathrin-coated vesicles in the receptor-mediate endocytosis pathway (6). Deliver enzyme to endosome/lysosome (7-8)


### I Cell Disease: Mistargeting of Lysosomal Enzymes to Extracellular Matrix
- Lack of N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase activity.
- Lysosomal enzymes lack M6P targeting signal → constitutively secreted (5a).
- Continued accumulation of undigested lysosomal contents → forms “inclusions bodies”, may eventually kill cells.
- Causes developmental, physiological, and neurological abnormalities.
- Referred to as Mucolipidosis.
- In vitro “cure” – M6P-enzymes added to I-cell fibroblasts – internalized by endocytosis pathway and function on arrival in lysosomes. VERY EXPENSIVE.

### Proteolytic Processing of Proproteins in Constitutive / Regulated Secretory Pathways

|![Proteolytic Processing](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5U0BQJ.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p657](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- Proproteins matured after leaving trans-Golgi.
- (a) Proalbumin processing – typical of proteins in constitutive secretory pathway: Furin endoprotease cleaves peptide.
- (b) Insulin processing – typical of proteins in regulated secretory pathway:
  - PC2 and PC3 endoproteases – cleave central region of insulin.
  - C peptide secreted with insulin. High C peptide levels → kidney problems or insulinoma. Low C peptide → low insulin (T1 diabetes).

### Sorting Proteins Destined for Apical and Basolateral Membranes of Polarized Cells

|![Sorting Proteins Destined ](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/18/5U0HTP.png)|
|:-:|
|[© Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p658](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Cell-Biology-Harvey-Lodish/dp/1464183392)|

- VSV G protein only on the basolateral membrane (VSV viruses bud only from the basolateral membrane.) Serosal Mucosal
- Influenza HA glycoprotein only on the apical membrane (Influenza viruses bud from only from the apical membrane). Also GPI proteins in some cell types
- IgA internalized at basolateral membrane and sorted to apical membrane by transcytosis
- Some hepatocyte apical membrane proteins sorted initially to basolateral membrane, endocytosed and transcytosed through endosomes to the apical membrane.
