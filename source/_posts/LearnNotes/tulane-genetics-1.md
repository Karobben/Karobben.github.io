## Who knows = =

Extra DNA, why?

## transposon

DAN transposon:
  - cut & paste
Retrotransposon:
  - copy & paste

DNA transposon:
transpoase recognize the IR sequences and cut it out.
Form a ==Pre-integration complex==
Jump into another site of DNA

**IR**: inverted repeat
**TSD**: target site duplication (direct repeat)

## Retrotransposons
Retrotransposons have shared similarity with retroviruses
Reverse transcriptase

Similar in life cycle, similar in gene structure.



## Consequence of transpositon

1. Insertion of a sequence in a new site
2. Cutting of DNA strands
Generally: mutagenic processes, generally bad in excess

Potential disadvantages:
- disruption of coding sequence
- deletion/rearrangements of the sequences
- non-allelic homologous recombination (based on similar seq contributed by transposons)
- alternative splicing
- Epigenetic alterations
- "transduction" of neighboring sequnces
- premature polyadenylation or other transcription defects


Benefits:
V(D)J recombination in vertebrates
- V(D)J recombination generates diversity in immune system
- The RAGI.RAG2 complex catalyses the programmed deletions during antibody rearrangement.


Exp a dramatic example of active retrotransposition that is "put to use" by the hose - Drophila telomeres

non-LTR retrotransposons replaces the function of the telomerase to extending the end of the linear chromosomes.

==P elements, more information need==

[P elements are transposable elements that were discovered in Drosophila as the causative agents of genetic traits called hybrid dysgenesis. The transposon is responsible for the P trait of the P element and it is found only in wild flies. They are also found in many other eukaryotes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_element#cite_note-pmdid26104714-1)[^1]

Generate Mouse models
- Spontaeous mutant starins
- chemical-induced mutatgenesis models
- Transplatntation/Engraftment models
- Transgenic and gene targeting models
- PDX mouse models.

PS: PDX can preserve the traits better than other for some reason.




Spontaneously arising mutatnt strain lethal yellow

- Maturity-onset obesity
- Adipocytehypertrophy
- hypertriglyceridemia
- Hyperinsulinemia
- Diabetes
- Hypatic lipogenesis
- Increased caloric efficiency


## Chmical mutagensis mouse models
- Germline: N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ENU (1/700 loci) (cause random mutations in sperm)
- Pancreas: Streptozotocin (destroys pancreatic β-cells), T1D
- Skin: 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) + TAP
- Lung: Nitrosamines
- Linve
- Bearst;
- Colon:
- Bladder

Cheap, quick, and generate lots of mutatios
- Hard to figure out where, when, and how it cause the mutation.

## ENU-induced mutatgenesis generates random mutat strains

1. Gene knockout → gene1 → Phenotype 1, 2, 3
2. Genome-wide mutatgenesis → lots of lots of genes → Lots of interested phynotypes

## Forward and reverse Genetic Screens
- Forward:
 - Spontaneously arising
 - Phynotype Screen
 - Mutation phenotypes reveal gene functions
 - Map the genes and identify the gen products

- Reverse genetic screen
 -

## ENU - induced mutagenesis

it oxidize the G and destroy the hydrogen bond of the G

## Forward genetic screen using ENU-induced mutagenesis

## Patient-dereived xenograft (PDX) Model

Plant cancers from human to growth on mouse.

## HGPS
- HGPS
- Muscular dystrophy
- Cardiomyopathy
- Lipodystrophy
- Mutation from **laminopathies**, Laminin A

Laminin A is a structural protein that forms nuclear lamina in inner nuclear membrane nuclear lamina is importatnt for maintatining interphase nuclear architecture heterozygous C to T substitution at 1824, G608G.

Target:
1. How Regulated
2. Variaty ways for regulation
3. Chromatin in regulation
4. Epigemetic Markers
5. RNA regulation (miRNA, post-TGR)

*[TGR]: Transcriptional Gene Regulation

1. Difference between the eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells:
  - One RNA pol in prokaryotic but 3 in Eu
  - Intron and exon
