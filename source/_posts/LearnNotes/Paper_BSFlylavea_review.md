>
>
>### Abstract
> - Grade level BSFL replacements for protein from fishmeal were fed.
> - replacement from 7%, 14%, 21%, 28%, to 36% (100% replacement to fishmeal)
>- growth performance could be maintain when replacement ratio < 25%
>
>### Results
>
>To begin with, the author talked about the difference between BSFL and FM. Which could responsible for the different growth performance. On the other hand, it explained an appropriate replacement could maintain the shrimp growth.
>
>### Discussion
>
>The survival ratio was not affected by the replacement.
>To consider the bodyweight gain, replacement <20% is appropriate.
>To consider the protein and lipid composition, replacement <7% is reasonable.
>Chia ... maybe not affect palatability since shrimp can digest it appropriately.
> The author also talked about the feeding environment of the shrimp with they didn't take the experiment and have no data.
>### PS
>In this paper, the author finished the experiment of replacing FM with the BSFL and the data shows that it does not affect the survival ratio. However, with the increase of replacement, the BWG, protein, and lipid composition was affected. In the discussion part, the author re-informed that the BSFL was different from the FM. The ratio of EAA/NEAA may be responsible for the relatively poor growth performance in higher ratio replacement diets. Though there are no experiments and data from the Chia and Culture environment(Green water VSFresh water), the other discussed them that they may not be important and have very limited effects on this experiment.

## Black Soldier Fly Full-Fat Larvae Meal as an Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil in Siberian Sturgeon Nutrition: The Effects on Physical Properties of the Feed, Animal Growth Performance, and Feed Acceptance and Utilization

cite: Rawski, Mateusz, et al. "Black Soldier Fly Full-Fat Larvae Meal as an Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil in Siberian Sturgeon Nutrition: The Effects on Physical Properties of the Feed, Animal Growth Performance, and Feed Acceptance and Utilization." Animals 10.11 (2020): 2119.

>### Summary:
> - The replacement was up to 30%.
> - feed Acceptance was increased by 10% and a higher replacement ratio
> - no effects on feed digestibility
>### Introduction
> ***1.*** The population of the sturgeon decreased dramatically during the second half of the 20th century. ***2.*** The plant protein-based diet is the main substitute for fish protein for carnivores. But sturgeons are highly sensitive to phytoestrogens. ***3.*** Insects are one of the main foods for juvenile sturgeons ***4.*** Defatting may decrease nutrition, for instance, AA and antimicrobial protein, in insect meal.
>### Results
>  As it shows in the Summary
>### Discussion
> **1**. compared the BSFL ingredient with other researches. **2**. Talked about how the non-protein resources of **N** could affect the crude protein conversion factor. **3**. Mineral balance of the diet. **4**. Physical properties of BSFL food pellets. **5**. The palatability of the BSFL meal: fatty, chitin, and free amino acids. **6**. Chitin shows antiviral activity and stimulates immune system ability. But it also reduces palatability, digestibility coefficients, and growth performance.
>### PS
> One marvelous thing is this research selected a fish that consume insects as the main food in juvenile age. So, they supposed the replacement diet has more beneficial effects than disadvantages on sturgeons. And it is. Besides, research was also focusing on how BSFL changes the physical properties of the feeding pellets which was rarely discussed among other papers. It also connected the physical properties to the palatability and digestibility coefficients of the pellets, though they have no data from this experiment. After that, they talked about the chitin, which has positive effects on fish when the concentration ratio is appropriate. However, this experiment shows that sturgeon could take all of advantages from chitin because not only the full-fatty BSFL has less chitin, but also sturgeon are highly adaptive to chitin diets in nature.

## Development of black soldier fly larvae production technique as an alternate fish feed

cite: Rana, KM Shakil, et al. "Development of black soldier fly larvae production technique as an alternate fish feed." International Journal of Research in Fisheries and Aquaculture 5.1 (2015): 41-47.
>### Abstract
>They tried a few diets for BSF feeding. And then feeding the fish with BSFL diet by the replacing ratio of T1(0%), T1(25%), T3(50%), and T4(100%). The growth performance of *monosex tilapiawas* T3 > T2 > T1 ≈ T4.
>### PS
>This research has two main parts. The first part is about rearing the BSF with different diets which I'd like to ignore. The second part is treating tilapia with gradient BSFL diets. They compared other few BSFL substitute diets kinds of research in discussion and concluded that they had a similar result: replacement ratio is up to 50%... Yeap, that's all. Let's move on!
>### Result
> ***1***. No significant growth performance, appetite, feed intake, conversion ratio, feed efficiency, or total digestibility were performed. A significant increase in apparent protein digestibility was observed. ***2***. Blood components have no significant differences. ***3***. Skin mucus immune response shows immune activity was boosted.
>### Discussion
> Comparing the results from the `Result` part to other papers.

cite: Katya, Kumar, et al. "Efficacy of insect larval meal to replace fish meal in juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer reared in freshwater." International Aquatic Research 9.4 (2017): 303-312.

>### Abstract:
> 0, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% replacement.
> BSFL as inferior protein ingredient to FM; 8 weeks trial. No significant different between 0%, 25%, and 50%. Crude protein and moisture were not affected. The broken line regression model believes that the substitution was up to 28.4%.
>### Result
>  ***1***.BSFL contains high crud lipids. Soybean meal containing high fiber contains. ***2***. Survival rates were from 80.5% to 100%.
>### Discussion
> It mentioned that the concentration of the BSFL could change by the feeding trails. The protein pf BSFL is inferior to FM, but parallel to soybean protein. After that, the author talked about other insect diet replacements and the effects of chitin, which is worthy to study further.

>### Abstract:
> The lysozyme activity reaches the maximum at 48% BSFL diet. The 25% of replacement has the highest body weight gain ratio. The survival rate was not significant among control and trials.
>### Introduction
> 1. The fish industry is growing, and fish food is important. 2. Plant protein substitute is cheap but inferior to fishmeal. It also compensates for human nutrition. 3. Animal protein is good and maybe a good choice. 4. Insect is awesome.
>### Result
> The highest ***WGR*** was found in T25%. The performance was poorer after the replacement larger than 68%. ***Body indexes*** were not significantly changed. No significant differences in ***moisture, ash, or crude protein*** were found. ***crude lipid*** significantly different in some diets. ***LZM*** is higher but not significant in trials. ***Serum SOD*** is significantly higher in some trials. ***Hepatopancrea SOD***, ***Phagocytic percentage***, and ***Phagocytic index*** didn't show a significant change.   
>### Discussion
> Compared to other researches, our result....
> The survival ratio is not significant but lower, which agrees with xxx's research.
> Growth performance is different among species.
> Nutrition ...
> Immune: the function of some properties... the BSFL diet increased the immunity of yellow catfish.
