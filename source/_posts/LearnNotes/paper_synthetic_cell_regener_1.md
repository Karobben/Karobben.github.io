## A partially self-regeneration synthetic cell

An experiment of self-regeneration in synthetic cell which could sustain synthetic activities over a day by regenerating the important building blocks(protein components).

**Fundamental Theory**:
Self-replication:
  - a set of instruction;
  - external building blocks;
  - energy
-- Von Neuman, 1940

**Challenge of transcription-translation system**:
  - protein synthetic rate must be sufficient to regenerate necessary components;
  - compounds should be functional synthesized;
  - allows continuous and sustained regeneration


**PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) system**
  - It could synthesize 70% of all *E. coli* protein
  - co-expression of multiple PURE components in single batch
  **Challenge:**
  - can't tell which protein is functional or not
  **Resolution:**
  employ the experiments of transcription-translation reaction operating inside microfluidic reactor to demonstrate self-regeneration of essential components.

1. 8 independent 15 nL chamber reactor, (b);
2. replacing 20% of of the reactor volume per 15min;
3. replacing ration: energy:protein/ribosome:DNA = 2:2:1;
4. 34℃ reaction environment;
5. expressed a fluorescent protein(eGFP)
6. three steps: ***kick-start*** -> ***self-regeneration*** -> ***washout***
