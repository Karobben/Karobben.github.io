### Transmembrane signaling: only a few mechanisms

1. Ligand-gated ion channel (iontropic receptros)
2. G-protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic)
3. Kinases-linked receptors
4. Nuclear receptors

### Signal Transduction

1. Synthesis of the signal
2. Release of the signaling molecule by the signaling cell: exocytosis, diffusion, cell-cell contact
3. Transport of the signal to the target cell
4. Detection of the signal by a specific receptor protein
5. Initiation of one or more intracellular signaltransduction pathways
6. A change in cellular metabolism, function or development triggered by the receptor-signal complex
7. Deactivation of receptor
8. Removal of the signal (downregulation) 12

## Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally
Cellular Tools for information transmission
Signal Transduction
- Ligands
  transmit signals
- Receptors
  receive information in form of a ligand transmits signal across membrane
- Transducers
  pass information enzymatically active may be signal integrators
- Adapters
  no catalytic activity modulate proximity of transducers
- Scaffolds
  provide architecture allow energetically unfavorable events
- Effectors
  perform an end function

### Ligands (structure)

Chamical structure, small molecules:
• Small molecules (e.g. amino acid or lipid derivatives, acetylcholine)
• Peptides (e.g. ACTH, vasopressin)
• ***Steroids***
• ***Retinoids***
• ***Thyroxine***
• Proteins (usually large & hydrophilic, bind to cell-surface receptors)

***(hydrophobic, bind intracellular receptors)***

### Major classes

• Hormones
• Growth factors, cytokines, chemokines
• Neurotransmitters
• Pheromones
• Can also be changes in metabolite concentration, e.g. oxygen or nutrients or physical stimuli such as light and heat

## Models of Cell Signaling
- ENDOCRINE SIGNALING
  Example: release of insulin by cells in the pancreas, travels in the blood stream and acts on distal liver, muscle and fat cells
- PARACRINE SIGNALING
  Examples: Growth factors and cytokines that signal to neighboring or surrounding cells
- AUTOCRINE SIGNALING
  Example: PDGF binds to PDGFproducing and secreting cells to stimulate cell growth
- SIGNALING BY MEMBRANEATTACHED PROTEINS
  Example: Delta-Notch signaling

  ### Not every ligand that binds to a receptor also activates the receptor
- **Agonists** are able to activate the receptor and result in a maximal biological response. The natural endogenous ligand with the greatest efficacy for a given receptor is by definition a full agonist (100% efficacy).
- **Partial** agonists do not activate receptors thoroughly, causing responses which are partial compared to those of full agonists.
- **Antagonists** bind to receptors but do not activate them. This results in receptor blockage, inhibiting the binding of agonists and inverse agonists.
- **Inverse** agonists reduce the activity of receptors by inhibiting their constitutive activity.


### What determines the cellular specificity of responses to ligands?

1. The presence or absence of receptors
2. The internal signal transduction or response machinery of individual cell types

### Ligands induce specific cellular response

### Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally


- Transducers
  They work as a gateway to the cell. As a result, they are crucial ... to regulate almost every known physiological process.” (Robert Lefkowitz)


###  Receptors can be classed as either

Cellular Tools for information transmission

Cell-surface receptors
OR
Intracellular receptors

### Intracellular (Nuclear) Receptors

• Can be located in the cytoplasm or the nucleus
• Bind to hydrophobic ligands that can diffuse across the plasma membrane
• Contain DNA-binding domains and act as ligand-regulated transcriptional activators or suppressors
• Characteristic lag period between ligand binding and cellular response of 30 minutes to several hours
• Effects of NR agonists can persist for hours or days after plasma concentration is zero

### Cell-surface receptors

Hydrophilic ligands bind to cell-surface receptors

### Properties of Cell Surface Receptors
• Integral membrane proteins
• Domain structure
    - Extracellular
    - Transmembrane
    - Intracellular
• Exhibit ligand binding specificity
• Ligand binding induces conformational change that exerts an effect intracellularly
• Effector specificity

### Seven Major Classes of Cell-Surface Receptors
Experimental Figure 15.3 Ligand Growth hormone binds to its receptor through molecular complementary. Binding Specificity

### Ligand Binding Specificity

### Ligands binding to different types of receptors lead to different physiological responses
(epinephrine)
(adrenergic receptors)

### Sensitivity of a cell to an external signal is determined by the number of surface receptors

### Maximal cellular response does not require binding of all receptors

50% of maximal response when only 18% of receptors bound with ligand
80% of maximal response is induced when 50% of the receptors are occupied

## Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally

- Transducers pass information enzymatically active may be signal integrators


### Protein kinases and phosphatases are employed in virtually all  signaling pathways

Figure 15.4 Regulation of protein activity by a kinase/phosphatase switch.


Figure 15.5 A simple signal transduction pathway involving one kinase and one target protein.


• ~ 600 kinases and 100 different phosphatases in human genome
• Target residues are ‘phosphoacceptors’ - Ser, Thr or Tyr
• Assembled into the ‘KINOME’
• Diversity encompasses transmembrane, simple and complex structures


### Post-translational modifications (PTM)

Ser/Thr directed Tyr directed
34
• Reversible addition of a small chemical group causes change in activity or location of a signaling protein
• PTMs require the action of both modifying and unmodifying enzymes (allowing the signal to be given and terminated)

### Second messengers

• Short lived, diffusible intracellular signaling molecules
• Elevated concentration leads to rapid alteration in the activity of one or more cellular enzymes
• Removal or degradation terminates the cellular response

## Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally
• Adapters
  no catalytic activity modulate proximity of transducers
•Scaffolds
  provide architecture allow energetically unfavorable events

### Signaling induced by protein-protein interactions

Cellular Tools for information transmission

Adapter has no catalytic activity, modulate proximity of transducers
Many signal-transduction pathways contain large multiprotein signaling complexes which are held together by adapter proteins

Signaling proteins are modular, consisting of groupings of highly conserved domains each with a specific function.

When used in combination, these domains allow the construction of specialized molecules with multiple input and output points. Use of domains ensures function only in the correct conditions/context


### Adapter - Protein clustering
MyrSH3 SH2 Kinase domain
site 1: Yact site 2: Yinhib
action
interaction
These regulatory interactions are mediated by specific protein domains
42
Clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the region
of the postsynaptic plasma membrane adjacent to the
presynaptic cell promotes rapid and efficient signal
transmission 43

- ***PDZ domains*** are protein-protein interaction domains recognizing mainly the C-termini of their target proteins
- ***Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains*** bind to specific phospho-tyrosine containing peptide motifs.
- ***Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains*** bind to proline rich peptides
- ***Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain*** Bind to phosphoinositides, bg-subunits of G-proteins and PKC

### Scaffolding protein provide architecture and allow energetically unfavorable events

### Lipid Rafts
Rafts, 10-50 nm, contain a max of 50 proteins along cholesterol, sphingolipids, and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins

### Caveolae are a special type of lipid raft

Coalesce with active signaling and might concentrate signaling proteins

May provide a microenvironment for signaling and help GPI-linked proteins signal across membrane

***Caveolae*** are small (50 -100 nm) invaginations in plasma membrane containing
***Caveolin*** on the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane
Caveolin helps form the flask-shaped pits involved in endocytosis
Caveolin interacts with cholesterol and may be play a role in transfer of cholesterol into lipid raft domains.
***Signal proteins*** that attach to the plasma membrane via lipid anchors tend to be concentrated in caveolae.


## Effectors

Cellular Tools for information transmission

### Many ligands bind to multiple types of receptors leading to different physiological responses
(epinephrine)
(adrenergic receptors)
48
Different Receptor ligand complexes can activate
the SAME response:
49
Example: Epinephrine or glucagon can activate glycogen breakdown and
release of glucose into the blood
Turning off or dampening signaling
50
Signaling Pathways often cross-communicate
Signaling Networks
51
the same cellular response
may be induced by multiple
signaling pathways by
distinct mechanisms
Interaction of different
signaling pathways permits
fine-tuning of cellular
activities
Cell-Cell Adhesion and Communication- Integrating Cells into Tissues
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) classes:
1. cadherins – cell-cell adhesion; calcium dependent e.g, E-cadherin, P-cadherin
2. Ig superfamily of CAMs – cell-cell adhesion; calcium-independent; some are found
enriched on specific cell types – e.g. N-CAM, V-CAM
3. Integrins – cell-matrix adhesion molecule e.g. a1 integrin, b1 integrin
Signal Transduction
• The effects of activation of cell surface receptors are
more complicated than a simple step-by-step
cascade
• By no means is signaling a linear event
• Extensive networking and cross talk
• Key is integration
• Why so complicated?
Amplification - Reliability - Redundance
53
When signaling goes wrong
• Dysregulated signaling results in inappropriate responses to stimuli
• Over- and under-reaction are equally devastating
• All disease is the result of
inappropriate,
inadequate or
over-enthusiastic signal transduction

Losing the Signal:
Type I Diabetes
When the target ignores the Signal:
type II diabetes
Too much signal: Stroke
Multiple breakdowns: Cancer
When a signal doesn’t reach its target:
Multiple Sclerosis
55
When signaling goes wrong
Oncogenic transformation
•Uncontrolled Proliferation
•Suppressed Apoptotic
•Downregulation of antigenic surface proteins
Many signaling proteins are oncogenes: activating or inactivating
mutations are sufficient to cause transformation
90% human tumors
have activating Ras
Mutations
Activating mutations of Ras,
Rac, Rho or cdc42 are
Enough to induce cellular
transformation
In the lab
Some cancer-causing
viruses encode an
activated form of src
Suppression of pro-apoptotic
genes will lead to
transformation
Amplification or
overexpression of Her2/neu
is associated with
aggressive breast cancers
Mutations of receptors may
lead to constitutive activity

Kd = dissociation constant
measures the affinity of the receptor for the ligand
R + L RL
k
on
koff
Kd = [L]
[R] = [RL]
Low Kd = high affinity of ligand for receptor
High Kd = low affinity of ligand for receptor
koff - rate constant for dissociation of a ligand
from its receptor
kon - rate constant for formation of the
receptor-ligand complex
At equilibrium koff = kon
Kd = The concentration of ligand at which half its receptors are occupied
Kd = koff/kon The lower stable the RL complex, thus the lower the K koff is relative to kon, the more d
The lower the Kd, the lower the ligand
concentration required to bind 50% of receptors
Kd = [R][L]/[RL] Simple equilibrium-binding equation
58
For high-affinity ligands, binding assays can determine the Kd
and the number of receptors per cell
1. Suspension of cells incubated
for 1 h at 4oC with increasing
conc. of 125I-labeled insulin
2. Pellet cells and wash away
unbound insulin
3. Measure radioactivity = total
binding
4. Repeat binding assay in the
presence of 100-fold excess
unlabeled insulin =
nonspecific binding
5. Subtract nonspecific binding
from total binding = specific
binding
6. Determine total number of
receptors per cell
7. Determine Kd
59
Isolation of Membrane receptors
Affinity chromatography: ligand is
chemically linked to polystyrene
beads - pass homogenate over
column - receptor binds - release
receptor by passing excess ligand
through column
60
A typical mammalian cell has between 1,000 and 50,000 copies of receptor
Affinity labeling: crosslink radiolabeled ligand to receptor- follow radioactivity in
purification
Cloning of Receptors
• Allow identification of receptors that constitute small percentage of total
cellular protein, and identification of receptors from small tissue source
• Expression cloning
• Homology cloning
61
Expression Cloning of
Receptors
• Make cDNA library from appropriate tissue
• Express library in cell line that does not
express the receptor of interest
• Use ligand binding to identify clone that
encodes receptor
62
Functional Expression Assay
• Divide library into smaller pools
to find clone that encodes
receptor
• Provided cells express relevant
signal-transduction proteins,
transfected cells will now exhibit
normal cellular response to
ligand X if the cDNA encodes the
functional receptor
63
Homology Cloning
- find additional variants of receptor
- find novel receptors
Degenerative PCR (odorant receptors)
Or screen library at low stringency (glutamate receptors)
Or database search (Taste receptors)
64
65
• Design degenerate primers that match amino acid sequences in conserved
region of receptor family members
• Use these primers in all pairwise combinations to amplify related sequences in
cDNA prepared from tissue suspected of expressing the new receptor
• Clone and sequence DNAs from PCR
• Examine sequence for hallmarks of receptor family
• Use these DNAs as probes to screen cDNA library from tissue known to
express receptor
• Examine proteins encoded by positive cDNA clones
Degenerative PCR Cloning
The structures and actions of receptors may be studied by using biophysical
methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, circular dichroism, and dual
polarization interferometry.
Computer simulations of the dynamic behavior of receptors has been used
to gain understanding of their mechanism of action.

Research of Dr. Robert Lefkowitz led to the identification, purification, reconstitution and cloning
of the adrenergic receptors; the discovery of their homology with the seven transmembrane
spanning visual light receptor rhodopsin and the realization that there was a large gene family of
G protein coupled receptors.
Dr. Brian Kobilka was the first to crystallize one of the beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes — a key
first step toward determining its structure. He was then able to show in great detail the structure
of this GPCR when it is binding to a hormone, just as it is poised to activate its G-protein, and as
it is turning on its associated G-protein.

69
Mouse erythrocytes progenitor cells were treated for 10 min with different concentration
of hormone erythropoietin
Example 2: A pull-down assay shows that the small GTP-binding protein Rac1 is activated by
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).

protein and two tandem SH2 domains from adapter protein Grb2.
B. EGFR activation and internalization in A549 cells. The EGFR biosensor plasmid was
transfected into the A549 cell line, the transfected cells treated with 100 ng/mL EGF to activate
EGFR and then the internalization process was observed in real time by fluorescence
microscopy. The increasing internalization of the biosensor-EGFR complex over time can be
quantitated using granularity analysis. 71
Figure 2. Specificity of A549 EGFR Biosensor Activity – EGF (100 ng/mL) stimulated
EGFR (ERBB1) internalization while Tyrphostin AG1478 (1 µM), a selective inhibitor of
EGFR, blocked receptor translocation to the plasma membrane and internalization.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, 100 ng/mL), a ligand specific for HGFR has low affinity
for EGFR and showed much less activity than EGF. Bar = 10 µm.
