## Cell’s social network

> No cell lives in isolation; life requires that all cells sense chemical and physical stimuli in their environment and respond which changes that can affect their function os development.

Responding of the cell signaling:
- differentiation
- proliferation
- exocytosis
- migration
- apoptosis
- adhesion
- senescence

### Receptors:

- Three domains:
  - Extracellular domain
  - plasma-membrane-spanning domain
  - intracellular domain
- Acts like a ligand
- Many signaling proteins are belongs to signal transduction proteins


### Transmembrane signaling: only a few mechanisms

1. Ligand-gated ion channel (iontropic receptros)
2. G-protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic)
3. Kinases-linked receptors
4. Nuclear receptors

### Signal Transduction

Snthesis → Release → Transport → Detection → Initiation → Functional Change → Deactivation → Removal

1. ==Synthesis== of the signal
2. ==Release== of the signaling molecule by the signaling cell: exocytosis, diffusion, cell-cell contact
3. ==Transport== of the signal to the target cell
4. ==Detection== of the signal by a specific receptor protein
5. ==Initiation== of one or more intracellular signaltransduction pathways
6. ==A change== in cellular metabolism, function or development triggered by the receptor-signal complex
7. ==Deactivation== of receptor
8. ==Removal== of the signal (downregulation)

## Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally

Cellular Tools for information transmission

- **Ligands**
  transmit signals
- **Receptors**
  receive information in form of a ligand transmits signal across membrane
- **Transducers**
  pass information enzymatically active may be signal integrators
- **Adapters**
  no catalytic activity modulate proximity of transducers
- **Scaffolds**
  provide architecture allow energetically unfavorable events
- **Effectors**
  perform an end function

### Ligands (structure)

Chamical structure, small molecules:
• Small molecules (e.g. amino acid or lipid derivatives, acetylcholine)
• Peptides (e.g. ACTH, vasopressin)
• ***Steroids***
• ***Retinoids***
• ***Thyroxine***
• Proteins (usually large & hydrophilic, bind to cell-surface receptors)

***(hydrophobic, bind intracellular receptors)***

### Major classes

• Hormones
• Growth factors, cytokines, chemokines
• Neurotransmitters
• Pheromones
• Can also be changes in metabolite concentration, e.g. oxygen or nutrients or physical stimuli such as light and heat

### Models of Cell Signaling
- ==ENDOCRINE SIGNALING==
  Example: release of insulin by cells in the pancreas, travels in the blood stream and acts on distal liver, muscle and fat cells
- ==PARACRINE SIGNALING==
  Examples: Growth factors and cytokines that signal to neighboring or surrounding cells
- ==AUTOCRINE SIGNALING==
  Example: PDGF binds to PDGFproducing and secreting cells to stimulate cell growth
- ==SIGNALING BY MEMBRANEATTACHED PROTEINS==
  Example: Delta-Notch signaling

### ==Not every ligand== that binds to a receptor also activates the receptor

- **Agonists** are able to activate the receptor and result in a maximal biological response. The natural endogenous ligand with the greatest efficacy for a given receptor is by definition a full agonist (100% efficacy).
- **Partial** agonists do not activate receptors thoroughly, causing responses which are partial compared to those of full agonists.
- **Antagonists** bind to receptors but do not activate them. This results in receptor blockage, inhibiting the binding of agonists and inverse agonists.
- **Inverse** agonists reduce the activity of receptors by inhibiting their constitutive activity.


### What determines the cellular specificity of responses to ligands?

1. The presence or absence of receptors
2. The internal signal transduction or response machinery of individual cell types

### Ligands induce specific cellular response

One type of ligand could trigger different type of respons in diffrent cell types.
Exp: Acetylcholine could initiate:
  - Pancreatic Acinar cell: Digestive enzymes
  - Pancreatic β cell: Insuline
  - Smooth Muscle: contraction
  - Parotid gland (saliavary): amylase enzyme

## Receptors

They work as a gateway to the cell. As a result, they are crucial ... to regulate almost every known physiological process.” (Robert Lefkowitz)


### Intracellular (Nuclear) Receptors

• Can be located in the cytoplasm or the nucleus
• Bind to hydrophobic ligands that can diffuse across the plasma membrane
• Contain DNA-binding domains and act as ligand-regulated transcriptional activators or suppressors
• Characteristic lag period between ligand binding and cellular response of 30 minutes to several hours
• Effects of NR agonists can persist for hours or days after plasma concentration is zero

### Cell-surface receptors

Hydrophilic ligands bind to cell-surface receptors

• Integral membrane proteins
• Domain structure
    - Extracellular
    - Transmembrane
    - Intracellular
• Exhibit ligand binding specificity
• Ligand binding induces conformational change that exerts an effect intracellularly
• Effector specificity

### Seven Major Classes of Cell-Surface Receptors

Experimental Figure 15.3 Ligand Growth hormone binds to its receptor through molecular complementary. Binding Specificity


-  Ligands binding to different types of receptors lead to different physiological responses
- Sensitivity of a cell to an external signal is determined by the number of surface receptors

- Maximal cellular response does not require binding of all receptors
50% of maximal response when only 18% of receptors bound with ligand
80% of maximal response is induced when 50% of the receptors are occupied


## Transducers

pass information; enzymatically active; may be signal integrators


### Protein kinases and phosphatases are employed in virtually all  signaling pathways

- Regulation of protein activity by a kinase/phosphatase switch.
- A simple signal transduction pathway involving one kinase and one target protein.
- ~ 600 kinases and 100 different phosphatases in human genome
- Target residues are ‘phosphoacceptors’ - Ser, Thr or Tyr
- Assembled into the ‘KINOME’
- Diversity encompasses transmembrane, simple and complex structures


### Post-translational modifications (PTM)

- Reversible addition of a small chemical group causes change in activity or location of a signaling protein
- PTMs require the action of both modifying and unmodifying enzymes (allowing the signal to be given and terminated)

- GTPase switch proteins cycle between active and inactive forms.
- Switching mechanism of G proteins.


### Second messengers amplify the signal

### Second messengers

- Short lived, diffusible intracellular signaling molecules
- Elevated concentration leads to rapid alteration in the activity of one or more cellular enzymes
- Removal or degradation terminates the cellular response


## Adapters and Scaffolds

no catalytic activity modulate proximity of transducers
provide architecture allow energetically unfavorable events

### Signaling induced by protein-protein interactions

Cellular Tools for information transmission

Adapter has no catalytic activity, modulate proximity of transducers
Many signal-transduction pathways contain large multiprotein signaling complexes which are held together by adapter proteins

- These regulatory interactions are mediated by specific protein domains
Signaling proteins are modular, consisting of groupings of highly conserved domains each with a specific function.
When used in combination, these domains allow the construction of specialized molecules with multiple input and output points. Use of domains ensures function only in the correct conditions/context


### Adapter - Protein clustering

Clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the region of the postsynaptic plasma membrane adjacent to the presynaptic cell promotes rapid and efficient signal transmission

- ***PDZ domains*** are protein-protein interaction domains recognizing mainly the C-termini of their target proteins
- ***Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains*** bind to specific phospho-tyrosine containing peptide motifs.
- ***Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains*** bind to proline rich peptides
- ***Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain*** Bind to phosphoinositides, bg-subunits of G-proteins and PKC

### Scaffolding protein provide architecture and allow energetically unfavorable events

### Lipid Rafts
Rafts, 10-50 nm, contain a max of 50 proteins along cholesterol, sphingolipids, and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins

### Caveolae are a special type of lipid raft

**Coalesce** with active signaling and might concentrate signaling proteins

May provide a microenvironment for signaling and help GPI-linked proteins signal across membrane

***Caveolae*** are small (50 -100 nm) invaginations in plasma membrane containing
***Caveolin*** on the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane
Caveolin helps form the flask-shaped pits involved in endocytosis
Caveolin interacts with cholesterol and may be play a role in transfer of cholesterol into lipid raft domains.
***Signal proteins*** that attach to the plasma membrane via lipid anchors tend to be concentrated in caveolae.


## Effectors

perform an end function
Cellular Tools for information transmission

### Many ligands bind to multiple types of receptors leading to different physiological responses

- Different Receptor ligand complexes can activate the SAME response:
Example: Epinephrine or glucagon can activate glycogen breakdown and release of glucose into the blood
- Turning off or dampening signaling


### Signaling Pathways often cross-communicate Signaling Networks

the same cellular response may be induced by multiple signaling pathways by distinct mechanisms

Interaction of different signaling pathways permits fine-tuning of cellular activities


### Cell-Cell Adhesion and Communication- Integrating Cells into Tissues
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) classes:
1. ==cadherins – cell-cell adhesion==; calcium dependent e.g, E-cadherin, P-cadherin
2. Ig superfamily of CAMs – cell-cell adhesion; calcium-independent; some are found enriched on specific cell types – e.g. N-CAM, V-CAM
3. ==Integrins – cell-matrix adhesion== molecule e.g. a1 integrin, b1 integrin

### Signal Transduction
- The effects of activation of cell surface receptors are more complicated than a simple step-by-step cascade
- By no means is signaling a linear event
- Extensive networking and cross talk
- Key is integration
- Why so complicated?
==Amplification - Reliability - Redundance==

### When signaling goes wrong
- Dysregulated signaling results in inappropriate responses to stimuli
- Over- and under-reaction are equally devastating
- All disease is the result of
  - inappropriate,
  - inadequate or
  - over-enthusiastic signal transduction

### When the target ignores the Signal:

Losing the Signal → Type I Diabetes
When the target ignores the Signal → Type II diabetes
Too much signal → Stroke
Multiple breakdowns → Cancer
When a signal doesn’t reach its target → Multiple Sclerosis

- Mutations of receptors may lead to constitutive activity
- Amplification or overexpression of Her2/neu is associated with aggressive breast cancers
- Suppression of pro-apoptotic genes will lead to transformation
- Some cancer-causing viruses encode an activated form of src
- 90% human tumors have activating Ras Mutations; Activating mutations of Ras, Rac, Rho or cdc42 are Enough to induce cellular transformation In the lab

Oncogenic transformation
  - Uncontrolled Proliferation
  - Suppressed Apoptotic
  - Downregulation of antigenic surface proteins
Many signaling proteins are oncogenes: activating or inactivating mutations are sufficient to cause transformation


### Studying Cell-Surface Receptors and Signal Transduction Proteins

Kd = dissociation constant measures the affinity of the receptor for the ligand

==Low Kd = high affinity of ligand for receptor==
==High Kd = low affinity of ligand for receptor==

- For high-affinity ligands, binding assays can determine the Kd and the number of receptors per cell
  1. Suspension of cells incubated for 1 h at 4oC with increasing conc. of 125I-labeled insulin
  2. Pellet cells and wash away unbound insulin
  3. Measure radioactivity = total binding
  4. Repeat binding assay in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled insulin = nonspecific binding
  5. Subtract nonspecific binding from total binding = specific binding
  6. Determine total number of receptors per cell
  7. Determine Kd

### Isolation of Membrane receptors

A typical mammalian cell has between 1,000 and 50,000 copies of receptor
Affinity labeling: crosslink radiolabeled ligand to receptor- follow radioactivity in purification

Affinity chromatography: ligand is chemically linked to polystyrene beads - pass homogenate over column - receptor binds - release receptor by passing excess ligand through column

### Cloning of Receptors

- Allow identification of receptors that constitute small percentage of total cellular protein, and identification of receptors from small tissue source
- Expression cloning
- Homology cloning

### Expression Cloning of Receptors
- Make cDNA library from appropriate tissue
- Express library in cell line that does not express the receptor of interest
- Use ligand binding to identify clone that encodes receptor

### Functional Expression Assay

- Divide library into smaller pools to find clone that encodes receptor
- Provided cells express relevant signal-transduction proteins, transfected cells will now exhibit normal cellular response to ligand X if the cDNA encodes the functional receptor

### Homology Cloning
- find additional variants of receptor
- find novel receptors
  - Degenerative PCR (odorant receptors)
  - Or screen library at low stringency (glutamate receptors)
  - Or database search (Taste receptors)

### Degenerative PCR Cloning

• Design degenerate primers that match amino acid sequences in conserved region of receptor family members
• Use these primers in all pairwise combinations to amplify related sequences in cDNA prepared from tissue suspected of expressing the new receptor
• Clone and sequence DNAs from PCR
• Examine sequence for hallmarks of receptor family
• Use these DNAs as probes to screen cDNA library from tissue known to express receptor
• Examine proteins encoded by positive cDNA clones

The structures and actions of receptors may be studied by using biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, circular dichroism, and dual polarization interferometry.

Computer simulations of the dynamic behavior of receptors has been used to gain understanding of their mechanism of action.
