excerpt: "Fish digestion is the process by which fish break down food and absorb nutrients. Studying fish digestion can help us understand how different fish species digest and utilize their food, which can be important for improving their diets and overall health. This knowledge can also inform aquaculture practices and help ensure sustainable fisheries. <a title='GhatGPT'>Who said this?</a>"

2. Buccal cavity
3. Pharynx
4. Oesophagus
5. Stomach
6. Intestine
7. Anus
8. Cloaca

## Sharks
reference:[The Shark Digestive System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELIGC3vDFeo)
### Digestive Tracks
1. Mouth
Grain Foods
Lack of salivary amylase
2. Esophagus
3. Stomach
4. Spiral Intestine (small intestine)
The place absorption and nutrients and toxins take palce
>- Duodenum (the first part of the spiral intestine)
>>- pyloric sphincter/ pylorus (First part of Duodenum)
>> The muscle expands and contrast to control the food into the duodenum  
(Spiral valve in the inside of intestine)
5. Colon (an enlarged Intestine)
> - water absorption
6. Rectum and Cloaca (the waste expelled)

### Digestive Organ
#### Liver
- detoxification (hepatic portal system)
> - HPS: gathering the blood from the GI track and taking it back to the liver to be detox.
- storage Clucose
- produces vile
- Squalene (Shark)
  It allows buoyancy because the oil is lighter than water
- bile (looks like green blister)
 stores at gallbladder

#### Spleen
Produces, stores, and breaks down blood cells
** Major Part of Immune system** for shark(fish)

#### Pancreas
- exocrine function: Pancreatic juices.
- endocrine function: regulating blood sugar (insulin).

#### Rectal Gland
salt gland: salty homeostasis

## Digestive System and Physiology of Digestion in Fishes
reference:[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Z8gEFeOAk)

### Pancrease
1. exocrine secretion into Intestine
2. Endocrine secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon

### Liver
1. Priduce **bile**
2. synthesis and stores **glycogen**

### Other Glands
1. Mucosal & sybmucosal lining of the fish contain some glands
2. Glandular structure of stomach comprises the gastric glands in the cardiac and the pyloric regions

### Gastric Phase of Digestion
#### Pepesin
*predominant gastric enzyme*
#### Trypsin
#### Carbohydrases
