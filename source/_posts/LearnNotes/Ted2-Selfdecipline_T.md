00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,417
Translator: Karobben

2
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:13,000
让我来告诉大家关于我妈的故事.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,292
我妈在生我的时候, 已经42岁了,

4
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:23,300
之后,她开始了她人生的第一次锻炼

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,792
一开始, 她只是再街区之间跑步,

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:32,209
紧接着, 她开始了5千米项目,
然后再是10千米跑,

7
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:36,400
再之后,她开始了马拉松运动,

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,792
最后直接开始参加铁人三项

9
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,292
但到了这个时候,她已经57岁了.

10
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:51,050
我妈也徒步去过Everest的营地.

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,918
(哈哈哈)

12
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:56,300
接下来, 我想说说我爸爸.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,792
(哈哈哈哈哈哈)

14
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:06,501
小时候, 我爸就经常带我去他的科学课上

15
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:12,400
同时, 他也是我高中的微积分学老师

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
(哈哈)

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,900
我当时简直想躲在课桌下面哭

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
(哈哈哈哈哈)

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,000
我从我妈那里学到了的重要的东西:

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
健康的重要

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,501
我从我爸那里学到了的重要的东西:

22
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,209
科学的重要.

23
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,876
这两个重要的观念, 为我人生的道路领航

24
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:40,300
这两个观念, 使我对我们所有人面对的"流行性问题"怀有感激.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,501
这个流行性问题不是埃博拉

26
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,792
相反,我指的是, 流行性的不健康生活习惯.


27
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:52,584
全球有超过5亿的过胖人口

28
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:56,918
然后, 你们可能会想, 在美国Surgeon General
第一次发布烟草有害的50年后,

29
00:01:56,918 --> 00:02:03,709
吸烟给我们带来的问题比预期还大.

30
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:09,292
现在, 全球有10已的烟民.

31
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:14,900
烟瘾和肥胖是两个最容易预防的

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,000
早逝诱因.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,417
解决这些问题就像完成拼图一样.

34
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,792
我们之所以会有这些不健康
的习惯,来源于我们的基因,

35
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,127
来源于我们大脑的神经递质,

36
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:33,000
来源于环境影响,比如同年人和媒体.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,292
这里的任何一小块拼图,

38
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:40,918
单靠我们自己是无法解决的.

39
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:47,292
但是, 其中有一块拼图,
也许掌握了问题之关键所在

40
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:52,162
我们对回应对抽烟和过度饮食等

41
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:58,709
上瘾行为的渴望的选择

42
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,792
我们的选择

43
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:04,000
这里有一个关于自控力衍生的新学科

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,501
也许掌握了逆转流行性问题的关键

45
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,209
他的名字叫"Willingness"

46
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,209
Willingness 意味着, 让你的
渴望产生与消失

47
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,083
同时, 并不用抽烟或者不健康饮食来回应

48
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:28,500
但,事实上, 我并不是来讨论意志力的,
我也不是来宣传

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,792
"通过渴望而获得力量"

50
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:34,918
相对的, 我是要提一个对于
渴望的, 不同的观点

51
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:39,258
就像这个样子:

52
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:44,209
停止对渴望的反抗

53
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:50,100
放宽心, 让这些渴望,合理的存在

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,501
并且, 心平气和的对待他们

55
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,900
现在, 在这个时候,
你们也许会非常怀疑(我说的)

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,000
(哈哈)

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,083
当几年前, 我第一次听见
这个的时候,我是(挺怀疑的)

58
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,667
那时候我一个朋友带着一本关于
"Willingness"的书跑过来

59
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,125
他对我说: "Jonathan,

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:17,709
这本书会永远的改变你的一生!"

61
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:24,000
然后我回答 "喔, 好...
嗯嗯... 嗯嗯, 我会看看的."

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,400
所以,我浏览了一遍,然后想,
"呐, 这就是一些, 心理絮语(心理疗法)"

63
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,709
然后我就把他丢在了一边.

64
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,083
直到几年以后当我老婆

65
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:39,200
带我去了华盛顿大学的一个
"Willingness"的研讨会

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,792
然后, 我被折服了.

67
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,501
所以, 我开始读起来一些书,

68
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,751
再接着, 我读了很多关于
"Willingness"的书.

69
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,792
并且, 我接受了相关的训练

70
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:53,083
之后, 我从中学到了.
"Willingness"是"接受与肯定疗法"

71
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:57,400
中的以改变行为
为目而去接受的一部分.


72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,417
它拓宽了改变行为的方法

73
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:04,209
这个已经被运用于帮助
焦虑症人群,上瘾人群

74
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,919
甚至有些创新的公司

75
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,086
用这个来帮助员工提高业绩

76
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:11,501
并且减轻他们的压力.

77
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,417
现在, 想要知道, 我
为什么被它惊讶到了

78
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:18,292
首先你们得知道, 我的环境.

79
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,209
在我的研究领域,

80
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,918
一个最常用的帮助人
们戒烟,减肥的方法

81
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,292
是教他们避免产生这种渴望.

82
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:32,709
不要产生吸烟的想法,分散你对食物的渴望.

83
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,417
有一首来之百老汇的歌曲完美的描绘了这个疗法.

84
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,000
他是这样唱到:

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
(旋律) 当你被你脑中的想法所困惑的时候

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,881
不要去想这些东西了

87
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:53,292
快停下来

88
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:58,300
像灯的开关一样把他关掉
就像我们

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,593
平常关灯一样,随手关掉它

90
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,876
当你感到有些想法不对的时候.

91
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:08,200
把这些讨厌的感觉当成床头灯一样关掉它们.

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,292
(2333)

93
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:15,709
(piapiapia)

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,292
我们都生活在这样一个环境中,

95
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:24,000
这里的歌曲不停的灌输着
"关闭这些不好的感觉."

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,584
那么现在, 让我们一起看看这些, 曲奇饼把

97
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:32,792
(哈哈哈)

98
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:37,700
这些新鲜出炉的饼干
(⊙o⊙ )哦, 他们看起来非常棒!

99
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,709
( ⊙o⊙)啊！, 这些饼非常的美味.

100
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:43,501
(⊙v⊙)嗯, 好好感受一
下来自对这些饼干的渴望

101
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,709
(⊙o⊙)哦, 它们是如此的可爱, 如此的美好.

102
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,292
乘现在, 关掉这个想法!

103
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:52,200
(哈哈哈)

104
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,209
关掉关掉它!

105
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,792
你们反而更想要这些饼干了, 对嘛?

106
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,334
你们可以发现, 阻止想这些, 是没有用的

107
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,292
你根本就不能阻止它!

108
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,792
所以,也许,你并不需要关闭它

109
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:10,501
也许, 你可以把这盏灯留着

110
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,709
就像这样:

111
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:18,500
My research lab at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center, here in Seattle,

112
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,792
is conducting randomized clinical trials

113
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:26,792
to see if showing people
how to be willing to have their cravings

114
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,292
is effective for quitting smoking.

115
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,709
We are conducting trials
and face-to-face interventions

116
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:39,209
and a telephone quit smoking hotline
and a website called `webquit.org`

117
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,000
and in an app called SmartQuit.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,417
These technologies have the potential
to reach millions of people

119
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:51,292
with interventions
that could save their lives.

120
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,918
That's pretty amazing.

121
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,792
And let me tell you about the data.

122
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:01,918
When you pool together the results
from six clinical trials,

123
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,209
all six that have been published to date,

124
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,083
including trials
conducted by our colleagues,

125
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,584
what we see is that for the people
who were assigned

126
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,627
to the avoidance approach -
avoiding your cravings —-

127
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,000
some of them quit smoking,

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,792
and it varied depending on the study.

129
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:24,459
However, for the people who were randomly
assigned to the willingness condition,

130
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,200
twice as many quit smoking.

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,792
Very, very encouraging.

132
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:36,082
Now, of course, the data only tell us
one small part of the story.

133
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,792
So, to help you see willingness in action,

134
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,958
I'm going to weave together
experiences I've had

135
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,584
in counseling people for quitting smoking.

136
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:49,100
And I'll together refer to them
as one person

137
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,918
that we'll just call Jane.

138
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:56,100
So, as is typical of people who come in
to want help for quitting smoking,

139
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,292
Jane was a 45-year-old person

140
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:02,584
who started smoking
when she was a teenager.

141
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,000
She tried to quit smoking several times
and was not successful.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,418
So, she was very skeptical
that anything "new"

143
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,918
was going to be helpful
to her for quitting,

144
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,417
and yet she was really hopeful
that this time would be different.

145
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,876
So, the first thing that I showed Jane
was to be willing,

146
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:22,417
that is to be aware,
of her cravings in her body.

147
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,300
So to notice where she felt cravings
in her body.

148
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
And what I did was I asked her

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,584
to journal that, and just to track
the intensity over time,

150
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:33,503
and to see if she'd smoke afterwards.

151
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,918
So in the middle of explaining this,
she stops me and says,

152
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:42,501
"What are you talking about?
I don't have cravings, I just smoke!"

153
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:47,209
So I said, "Well, why don't you try it,
and we'll see what happens,

154
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,627
and if it doesn't work,
we'll try something else."

155
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:53,051
So she came back a week later
and she said,

156
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,390
"You know, I've been tracking my cravings,

157
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,792
I've been tracking them all the time.

158
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:04,400
And now I can't stop
thinking about smoking!

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,083
(Laughter)

160
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,292
What am I supposed to do?"

161
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:13,709
Well, before I tell you my answer,
let'’s look behind the scenes.

162
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,679
Now, what was probably going on here

163
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,250
was that Jane
was having cravings all along,

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,209
and like a lot of us,
she was living on autopilot.

165
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,292
(Laughter)

166
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,709
You wake up in the morning,
you smoke a cigarette,

167
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,009
you have a cup of coffee,
you smoke a cigarette,

168
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,381
you get in the car, you smoke a cigarette.

169
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:38,501
We're often just not aware of
what we think, what we feel before we act.

170
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,918
So, my answer to Jane was to be willing,

171
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:44,107
and one of the ways
I showed her to do that

172
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:48,000
was with an exercise called
"I am having the thought".

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,584
So, one of Jane's thoughts
before she had a cigarette was,

174
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,876
"I'm feeling a lot of stress right now,
I really need a cigarette."

175
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,419
So I asked her to add the phrase

176
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:00,918
"I'm having the thought" like this.

177
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,160
"I'm having the thought

178
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,514
that I'm feeling a lot of stress right now
I really need a cigarette."

179
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:10,417
Then I asked her to add the phrase
"I'm noticing I'm having the thought,"

180
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,918
so "I'm noticing
that I'm having the thought

181
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:14,918
that I'm feeling
a lot of stress right now,

182
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,334
I really need a cigarette."

183
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:21,918
Now, we can all do an exercise like this
when we have any kind of negative thought.

184
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:26,200
Like for my thought
that "I'm boring all of you with my talk"

185
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,709
(Laughter)

186
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:32,209
and I'm having the thought
that I'm boring all of you with my talk.

187
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,502
So, what this exercise did
is it gave me a little bit of space

188
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:37,918
between me and my thoughts.

189
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:40,083
And it's in that space

190
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:45,870
that I can choose not to run off
the stage in front of 1,500 people.

191
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,417
(Laughter)

192
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:50,709
And the fact is we don't act
on every thought we have,

193
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,350
because if we did, we'd all be
in a whole lot of trouble.

194
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,417
(Laughter)

195
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,210
So, this was helpful to Jane,
but there was something else

196
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,209
that was really difficult for Jane.

197
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,209
I felt a lot of compassion
for her about it.

198
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,584
That was the judgment that she felt

199
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:14,501
from people when she would be
outside smoking a cigarette.

200
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,501
The criticism from her husband
for being a smoker,

201
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:24,292
and the self-loathing
that she developed about smoking.

202
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,709
And she dealt with this shame
by having a cigarette,

203
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,918
which gave her relief temporarily
until the shame came back.

204
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,584
So, I said to Jane,

205
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:41,792
"What would it be like
if we tried to honor this feeling of shame

206
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:45,709
as part of the human experience?

207
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:50,600
If you had a close friend
who is feeling shame about smoking,”

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,918
I said to Jane,

209
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:58,292
“what would you offer this friend
as words of caring and kindness,

210
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:03,792
and could you then offer those words
to yourself, Jane?"

211
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,292
And she looked up,

212
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:12,584
and she had this look of this temporary
respite from the shame,

213
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,918
which made it just
a little bit easier next time

214
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:19,083
not to act on the craving.

215
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,709
So, here is the secret to self-control:

216
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,918
the secret to self-control
is to give up control.

217
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,002
Because otherwise,

218
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:33,417
we get into a tug-of-war with a monster,
a craving monster.

219
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,083
And the craving monster says,

220
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:40,500
"Come on, smoke a cigarette.
Come on, have that cookie. Come on!"

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,297
And you're on the other side saying,

222
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:45,167
"No craving monster,
I'm going to distract myself from you,

223
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,167
I'm going to ignore you,
no, no, no, no."

224
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,553
And the craving monster says,
"No, no, come on, you know you want it!"

225
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:51,829
And you're just back here

226
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,244
and you're going back and forth
and back and forth

227
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,743
and pretty soon the craving monster
overpowers you

228
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,324
— you have that cookie,
you have that cigarette,

229
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:01,419
until the craving monster comes back.

230
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,292
And then you're in the tug-of-war again
doing what we've learned how to do.

231
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:09,203
Unless -

232
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:12,203
unless you drop the rope.

233
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:13,538
And what you discover

234
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:16,709
is that if you just allow
the monster to be,

235
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,792
to occupy a space in your body,

236
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,294
you discover in a few minutes

237
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:25,918
that the craving monster is not
as threatening as he appears.

238
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:29,918
And sometimes, he even goes away.

239
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,900
As we break for lunch, we're going to have
choices of what to eat.

240
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,083
(Laughter)

241
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:47,417
When you see them, try to be aware
of the cravings in your body,

242
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,626
try to be willing to have those cravings.

243
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:52,501
See if they pass on their own.

244
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:56,294
Whatever choice you make,
try to bring a spirit of caring

245
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:59,209
and kindness to yourself,

246
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:04,200
for that is the mountain
that we are all climbing.

247
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,584
Thank you very much.

248
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,586
(Applause)
