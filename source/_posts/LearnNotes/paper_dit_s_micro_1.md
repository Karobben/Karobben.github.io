## Abstract
Microbiota data was collected from stomach, foregut, midgut, and hindgut.

## Results:
Reduce the survival ratio: 88% to 60%
Microbiota of the water was also analysed inorder to study the mutual impact of the system.

Alpha diversity has **no significant different** between diet switch groups.

<a title="发光杆菌属">***Photobacterium***</a> and <a title="链球菌属">***Streptococcus***</a> which were highly represented in the AA0 and FM100 diets

<a title="变形菌门">***Proteobacteria***</a> was more related to wheatmeal, while <a title="厚壁菌门">***Firmicutes***</a> were more abundant in fishmeal


### Aquaculture environment
<a title="黄杆菌科">***Flavobacteriaceae***</a>, <a title="红杆菌科">***Rhodobacteraceae***</a>, and <a title="腐败螺旋菌">***Saprospiraceae***</a> are pretty common in Aquaculture environment.

In this study,  ***Rhodobacteraceae*** was found in higher percentages in wheatmeal group. This shows that food could affect the colonization of GIT by bacteria present in the surrounding water



### Diet switch

- Contributed the low survival ratio to anti-nutrition factors, tannins, for example.
- <a title="肠杆菌科">***Enterobacteriaceae***</a> was abundant in wheatmeal in responsible to the digestion of polysaccharide.
-  <a title="棒状杆菌属">***Corynebacterium***</a>, <a title="丙酸菌属">***Propionibacterium***</a>, and <a title="梭状芽孢杆菌属">***Clostridium***</a> were abundant in fishmeal gut.
- Diversity and Richness were not significantly changed
- Higher percentage of  <a title="变形菌门">***Proteobacteria***</a> (Which related to high efficiency of nutrition absorption)
- variate in individuals? ...
