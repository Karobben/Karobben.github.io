## Cellular Biology 2

Bacterial gene are clustered by function (it could regulated by a same prone)

THe invention of most cellular enzymatic mechanisms and biochemical pathways occured early in microbs and we are inherits it.


## Do human continue to evolve?

1. mtDNA mutation making more heat than ATP. Common in Artuc peoples
2. Sickle-cell hemogolobin mutations conferring malarial resistance.
3 CCR5 delta32 mutation impairing HIV binding to white blood cells. Found esp. In NE, Speculate that it protected against some other pathoge 700 years ago/
4. Pre-disposition of hunter-gathere populations t obesity and type-2 diabetes in wester diet.
5. Mutation in the Tibetan populations enabling high blood O2 EPAS2 variatn  inherited form Denisovans.
6. Multople copies of salivary amylase in populations with high-starh diet

Q1: whay aren't there alternative forms of life on Earth?

Nasa: search for L-isoleucine

## Separated perticula questions from biology and lack of the big picture.

Z ion channel; Methane; virus; Phosphorite sugar, ribosome, Chromosome separation, Chaperones.

So, the question is What is 'life'?

1. Metabolism pathway is very complicated.
, The hard part about bilogy is its complexity:
 from isolated cell → clonal collaboration → consotia of multiple species → Tissues → Systems
Even a single cell too complex to be understand.

1. Which genes are necessary for something to live?
    - it could help ua to understadn how a cell work,
    - how life evolved
    - build an artificial organism.

Number of Genes:
E. Coli: 4200
Stretomyctes: 9000
saccharomyces cerevisiae: 6200
human: 22000

## What are the essential parts of a cell?
- Mycoplasma genitalium: 525 genes, an intracellular parasite.
    - Lack a cell wall. 
    - in a stable environment, so a few adaptive strategies
    - Depends on hosts as a source of nutrients.
- What genes are universal?
    Hemophilus influenzae: 1815, 256 shared with M. geneitalium.
Challenge:
    - different isozymes could perform the same critial processe: rebonucleoacid redundant: With/without oxygen
    - BActeria and eukarya make esterified lipids.
    - Humans oxidize NADH via a respiratry chain, yeast do it by making alcohol.
    - The specific mechanisms are non-universal- but they are essential to the organism.

## Reasoning from first principles.

Transport
Energy: carry lots of thermodynamic unfavorite actions for life.

## Which Genes cannot be knocked out without loss of viability
- insert transposon: gene knock out: sequencing the clone and get the non-essential genes

No mutation list:
- tRNA synthetases
- Ribosome
- Translation factors
- Protein secretion
- Chaperones
- DNA replication
- Transcription
- Cell division
- Nucleotide synthesis
- Cofactor synthesis
- Fatty acid synthesis
- Cell wall synthesis
- Some ventral metabolism

171 gene in E. Coli were not knocked out.
- biosynthetic genes and catabolic genes (medial is rich in lots of source)

435 genes are essential for microplasmid and it growth much slower than normal
