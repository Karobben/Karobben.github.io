description: "A concise overview of the CR9114 antibody's binding to influenza A viruses, highlighting its effectiveness and comparison with other antibodies."
excerpt: "This post provides a detailed exploration of the CR9114 antibody, focusing on its binding properties and effectiveness against various influenza A virus strains. It covers the specific gene segments from which CR9114 is derived, explaining its broad reactivity to both group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. The article highlights the significance of the HA stem region in the virus and how CR9114's binding to this region blocks the necessary conformational changes for viral entry into host cells. Additionally, it compares CR9114 to other antibodies like CR6261 and FI6v3, discussing their different binding modes and effectiveness. The content is technical and geared towards readers with a background in biology and immunology."

## Pan fluenza family


- CR9114 from V~H~1-69[^Med-2020-Wu-a038778]: <ai>This antibody, derived from the V~H~1-69 gene segment, is known for its broad reactivity against both group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses. CR9114 binds to a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem region. This region is involved in the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, a critical step in the viral infection process. By binding to this region, CR9114 can block the conformational changes required for membrane fusion, thereby inhibiting viral entry into host cells.</ai>
- CR6261 from V~H~1-69[^Med-2020-Wu-a038778]: <ai>Also originating from the V~H~1-69 gene segment, CR6261 specifically targets group 1 influenza A viruses. Like CR9114, CR6261 binds to the stem region of HA, but its binding is more restricted to group 1 viruses. This antibody stabilizes the pre-fusion form of HA, preventing the structural rearrangements necessary for the virus to fuse with the host cell membrane.</ai>
- FI6v3 from V~H~3-30[^Med-2020-Wu-a038778]: <ai>Derived from the V~H~3-30 gene segment, FI6v3 is notable for its broad neutralizing activity against all known subtypes of influenza A viruses. This broad reactivity is achieved through its binding to a conserved epitope in the HA stem region, similar to CR9114 and CR6261. However, the precise mode of binding and the epitope details might differ, contributing to its unique broad-spectrum activity.</ai>
- CR8020[^Med-2020-Wu-a038778]: <ai>CR8020's mode of binding is distinct from the others. It targets a specific epitope in the HA stem region that is predominantly present in group 2 influenza A viruses. By binding to this site, CR8020 can inhibit the necessary conformational changes in the HA protein during the virus's entry into the host cell, thereby neutralizing the virus.</ai>

## CR9114

### Light Chain

<ai>The CR9114 light chain contains a specific sequence motif in its CDR L3 region that is important for binding to the HA stem of the influenza A virus. The motif consists of two aromatic amino acids, Trp91 and Trp96, which are positioned toward the heavy chain with limited space in between. These aromatic residues participate in π-π stacking interactions with the HA protein, specifically with the tryptophan residue at position 91, which is located in the CDR L3 region.</ai>[^PIIS2211124723014225] 

- Importance of CR9114 light-chain residues 91 and 96[^PIIS2211124723014225]
  - Trp91: <ai>This tryptophan residue is located in the CDR L3 region of CR9114 and has been identified as a key residue for HA binding. It forms a π-π stacking interaction with the tryptophan residues in the HA stem, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the amide and carbonyl groups.<ai>
  - Small amino acid Ala at VL residue 96, which points toward the heavy chain with limited space in between
  - <ai>The binding activity of CR9114 to the HA stem was found to be abolished when the non-aromatic amino acids threonine (T), arginine (R), or alanine (A) were substituted for the aromatic residue tryptophan at position 91. Similarly, substitution with aromatic amino acids tyrosine (Y) or phenylalanine (F) did not disrupt binding activity. This suggests that the presence of an aromatic residue at position 91 is essential for CR9114 binding to the HA stem.<ai>[^PIIS2211124723014225]

### Heavy Chain

- **Y98**, **Y99**, **Y100**, and **Y100a** in CDR H3 (heavy chain)[^PIIS2211124723014225]
- **H95** and **N97**: the side chains of both VH H95 and VH N97 are not interacting with the HA stem epitope. Instead, both VH H95 and VH N97 form intramolecular interactions to stabilize the CDR H3 conformation. 
  - **H95** H-bonds with VH **S100b** and VH **S35** as well as interacts with VH **Y100** via T-shaped p-p stacking
  - **N97** H-bonds with VH **Y99** and VH S100b[^PIIS2211124723014225]
- Most CDR H3 variants are incompatible with CR9114 for HA stem binding[^PIIS2211124723014225]

Residues IDs as labelled in orange are converted to the somatic sequence as in the PDB structure (table). Mutated residues required (53) for gaining affinity for H1, H3, and B HA are indicated in the table (+ required mutation, *mutation improves binding).

## CR9114 and CR6261

CDR1:
- CR9114: The **I73** in the FR3 loop allows CR9114 to ﬂip into the hydrophobic groove of inﬂuenza H5 (Figure 3C) and H3
- CR6261: **D73**: Its side chain has a different conformation and ﬂips out of the hydrophobic groove of H5.
  - **R30—D73** form a stable and preferable internal H-bond
  - **D73(FR3)—R30 (HCDR1) —Y32 (HCDR1)** and **A33(HCDR1)—G97 (HCDR3)**: expanded HCDR1 loop brings **F29** into the groove nearby for interacting with the hydrophobic pocket of H5

CDR2: 
- CR9114: polar **S52**
  - internal H-bond with **Y98** (HCRD3) which can induce enlargement of the HCDR2 loop
  - HCDR2 loop of CR9114 can block a larger space at the binding groove of HAs, and several residues at this loop can interact with H3 HA F54-W21(H3),
- CR6261: hydrophobic **I52**
  - backbone atoms of **I52**-**G55**/**T56** and **P52A**-**F54** pair form H-bonds → small and rigid HCDR2 loop of CR6261

CDR3:
- CR9114: ^96^GNYYYYSG^100C^
  - It establishes crucial H-bonds with H5 HA (**Y98**-Q42, **Y98**/**Y100A**-D19) and H3 HA (**Y98**-T41/Q42, **Y100A**-D19)
  - A short distance between **Y99** (CR9114) to the backbone atom of V18 can induce a strong charge-charge interaction between CR9114 and HAs
- CR6261: ^96^MGYQVRET^100C^
  - only **Y98** can form an H-bond with a residue
  - Longer distances between CR6261 residues and HA residues V18 and D19 result in very weak interactions: 7-8 Å for **Q99**–V18 and 11 Å for **R100A**-D19
