## Abstract
1. Physiological study of S. hasta exposure to the Cu is studied, but **RNA-Seq is not**. (PS: this experiment is **Unique**)
2. Some **Statistic information** from RNA-seq.
3. Major change of **pathways** are...
4. This experiment is pretty useful.

## Introduction

P1: Cu contamination is harmful. **Comprehensive understanding** of the mechanisms is lack.
P2: Problems caused by Cu exposure are **too complicate to** be explained by few regulatory entities, as a result, a whole gene expression profiling is need.
P3: Though, previous studies find that lipid deposition and metabolic activity were changed,they focus on **few genes only**. Now, it is the first time for people profiling the RNA-Seq of this species.

## M&M
- Fish and Cu exposure
- Sampling and total RNA extraction
- cDNA library preparation and Illumina sequencing
- De novo assembly and function annotation
- Identification of differentially expressed genes
- Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation
- Statistical analysis

## Results
- Illumina sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly
- Function annotation and classification of unigenes
- Differentially expressed genes involved in immune system
- Differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis
- Differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction
- Validation of differential gene expression by qPCR

## Discussion
- Liver transcriptome of S. hasta generated by RNAseq
- Differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism
- Differentially expressed genes involved in immune system
- Differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis
- Differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction

### Liver transcriptome of S. hasta generated by RNAseq
1. Statistic information of De novo result. (PS: you may think this things was mentioned before. Yes, it is, But here, the author made a <span style="color:salmon;"><b>comparing with other species</b></span>. So, it is ok to recite them again)
2. COG is useful, GO is useful, KEGG is useful. (PS: What the hex??? Probably is because this paper was published in 2015. So, it might be done at 2014 or even earlier.)

### Differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism
1. General background information and cited a bunch of recent study(PS: his study).
2. But the RNA-Seq is absent. So, this experiment is useful and meaningful.(PS: Again, recite the lyrics from the Abstract and Introduction)
3. It provide the evidences of mitochondrial damage and inhibition of B-oxidation. (PS: Gosh, finally, we see something new. And end of this section.)

### Differentially expressed genes involved in immune system
1. BG information of immune system and the benifitial of the RNA-Seq. (PS: Suggest to ignore)
2. Interested Pathways and their BG infor.
3. Filled with a list of DEGs, and compared few of them with other studies.
4. suggest that immune reaction were involved in Cu-induced stress.

### Differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis
1. BG infor for Apoptosis and CASP3.
2. Calpain up-regulated; caspase-3 down-regulated, this was support in other two reports. (PS: <span style="color:salmon;"><b>They spend 236 words to interpret five words</b></span>: Calpain up-regulated; caspase-3 down-regulate)

### Differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction
1. BG: for MAPK pathway. Evidences from other papers.
Here: c-fos involved in this pathway.
2. Cu could induce ROS to active MAPK to elevate the phosphorylation. (PS: No ending sentence for this paragraph. The last sentence is lack of coherent.)
3. (P2) BG: NF<sub>k</sub>B is an important redox-sensitive TF for immune-response.
Here: NF<sub>k</sub>B down-regulated.
But, there have no consensus on it. So, more experiments are needee.
(PS: This paragraph is mach readable than few previous)
4. BG: important of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> can effect Ca<sup>2+</sup>
Here: Cu down-regulated genes in the calcium signaling pathway.
The understanding of this process is helpful.
5. Conclusion: This experiment is unique and this experiment has lots of potential contributions...


PS: Finally, I finished this paper. Personally, I'm not suggesting anyone to read this paper really much. Because it is a kind of wasting time if you want to learn how to writing from this passage. You can perceive that too much of non-sense words are filled for words-accumulating. And some sentences are lack of coherent. But, of course, it could be a good counter example because  it is not the worst, it's still a readable paper, it's just not a good model. And I just don't like it.
