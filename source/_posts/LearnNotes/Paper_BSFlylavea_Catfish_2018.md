## Abstract
- 65 days feeding trial
- 0% (control), 13%, 25%, 37%, 48%, 68%, 85% and 100%.
- Increasing weight growth performance
- Increasing immune index
- 29.1% of replacement has the best effect on growth and immune index
- could partially replace the fish meal

## MATERIALS AND METHODS
Six day old BSFL was collected at the first day as it appearance of pre-pupae.


## Results

## Discussion

- 25% of the replacement has the best effects on the fish.
- replacement is up to 48%
  - This agree with up to 45% replacement in juvenile European seabass(Magalh~ aes et al., 2017).[^paper1]
  - yellow mealworms meal could only replace 18% of the FM diet.(Su et al.,2017)[^paper2]
- The value of Lue is higher than previous studies.
- Chitin might influence the feed intake, availability and digestibility of the nutrients and growth performance of the fish (Cummins et al., 2017)[^paper3]
- Increasing the immune index, might casued by the Chitin
- Chitin may also responsible to the decrease of the palatable.
