## Failure of Classical Mechanics 

### Black Body Radiation

- **Experiment**: measure the radiation intensity as a function of frequency of the radiation emitted from a black body (a physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation) at thermal equilibrium
- **Model**: Emitted radiation is classically due to oscillating electric dipoles within the material, acting like broadcast antennas.
- **Classical expectation**: higher temperature should result in a large increase in the radiation emitted at high frequencies (fast oscillation at high T)

!!! note Gustav Kirchhoff
    The blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation (such as light), regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.
    
    A black body can also emit black-body radiation, which is solely determined by its temperature.

###  Black-body Radiation Spectrum: Intensity vs. Wavelength

Notic: the "Cold" object also emit "light" as long as its above the absolute zero (-273.15 °C). And it would appear "blakc" because the peak wavelength is in infrared range, which human eye cannot recognize.

According to this theory, we could astimate the temperature of stars based on its color.

### Wien’s Displacement Law

$ \lambda _{max} = \frac{W}{T} $
- $  \lambda _{max} $: Peak wavelength
- W: Wien's constant = 2.9 e^-3^ m Kelvin
- T: Surfave temperature

Exp:

When &lambda;~max~ = 500nm:
$T = \frac{W}{\lambda_ {max}} = \frac{2.9 e^ {-3} mK}{500e^ {-9}m } = 5800K$

### Rayleigh-Jeans law (Classical description of light)

- Predict the spectral irradiance (or spectral density) of a black body radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency for a fixed temperature.
- Spectrum Density (&nu;, T) = $\frac{8\pi\nu^2}{ c^3 }k_BT$
    - c: speed of light
    - k~B~ = Boltzmann constant = 1.380649 × 10^-23^ J/K
    - T: temperature
    - &nu;: frequency
