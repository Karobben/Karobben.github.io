## Fourier Transforms
Addtional infromation:


## Fourier Series and Fourier Transform
> **Fourier Series**
>
> Fourier series simply states that, periodic signals can be represented into sum of sines and cosines when multiplied with a certain weight. It further states that periodic signals can be broken down into further signals with the following properties.
> - The signals are sines and cosines
> - The signals are harmonics of each other
>
>Although both **Fourier series** and **Fourier transform** are given by Fourier , but the difference between them is:
>  - Fourier series is applied on periodic signals
>  - Fourier transform is applied for non periodic signals
>
> **Fourier transform**
> The Fourier transform simply states that that the non periodic signals whose area under the curve is finite can also be represented into integrals of the sines and cosines after being multiplied by a certain weight.
> The Fourier transform has many wide applications that include, image compression (e.g JPEG compression), filtering and image analysis.
