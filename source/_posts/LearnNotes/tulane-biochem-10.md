## Enzymatic Catalysis, Catalytic Mechanisms

> 1.General Properties of Enzymes
> 2.Activation Energy and the Reaction Coordinate
> 3.Catalytic Mechanisms4.Serine Proteases (pp. 342-347)

> - Give examples of various levels of substrate specificity, and explain specificity differences exhibited by serine proteases
> - Give examples of reactions that utilize coenzymes NAD, FAD, Coenzyme A, and lipoic acid (metabolism lectures), and specify the role of the coenzyme
> - Describe catalysis in terms of a reaction-coordinate energy diagram
> - Classify enzymes by type of reaction
> - Explain catalysis by enzymes in terms of chemical mechanisms
> - Elaborate the catalytic mechanism of a chymotrypsin
> - Explain divergent and convergent evolution
> - Discuss the similarity of primary structure vs. tertiary structure in proteins as evidence supporting the existence of homology

## Enzymes differ from chemical catalysts

- rates↑; Reaction specifity↑
- Mider reaction conditions
- Capacity for regulation

### How Enzymes Work

- trhough the foramtion of weak bonds between the enzyem and the substrate.
- help arrange the substrate in a position favorable for reaction

### Catalysis by Transition-state Stabilization

CH_3_ than H, rate increased 315 times: transition-state stabilization
Carbon -> Aceessi  for the hydroxyl group;

L-Proline → [Planar transition stte] → D-Proline
L-Proline : 109.5°; transition state: 20°


I have no chemical background, so go on hell
I am so tird. Thats increadible. Let's keep type so I do fall into sleep.

alkane → ahlcohole → aldchyl → Exrebexyl
R-CH₃ → R - CH₂OH → R-CH=O → R-C=C=H

### Substrate Specificity


1. Lock Key model:
    - Hexokinase: 6C sugure, glucose, very specifics.
    - Founder: Fisher (Projection)
    - Enzyme distinguish different sugar model
2. Something like Ahlcohole Dehydrase methanol, Ethanol
    - Methanol → Carboxyl acid (toxity)
    - Drinking Ethanol to inhibitor Methanol metabolism


### Example of “high” specificity (stereospecificity)

Citrate ←(Aconitase)→ Isocitrate

Enzyme is so large to interacte with the complex.

If you rotated the molecue,,

### Example of “low” specificity (geometric)

Chymotrypsin:
  - Peptide: `RCO::NHR' + H₂O → RCOO¯ + H₃N⁺R'`
  - Ester: `RCO::OR' + H₂O → RCOO¯ + HOR' + H¯`

Trypsin; Elastase

### Example of enzyme that uses a coenzyme/cosubstrate

Ethano ←(ADH)→ Acetaldehyde

Adenosine: Oxidized Form ←→ Reduced Form

NAD⁺ \ NADP⁺
V~B~, whichi needs by Mitochondria: nicotinamide riboside

As aging, the V~B~ gets low, supply in precouser to aging mouse, mitochondria could,
In humane: hearing lost in loud noise rescue.


### Acid-base Catatlysis

| Keto →  | Transition state |→ Enol |
| -------------: | :------: |:-|
|     | Form 1       ||
|     | Form 2 + Acide    ||
|     | Form 3 + Base      ||


Different forms has difference entropy.

### Metal Ion Catalysis

Zn Coordinate with His to do complex things.

### Catalysis by Proximity and Orientation

### Catalytic triad of chymotrypsin and other serine proteases

### Serine protease mechanism (Exam)

Imtermider: not transition state, it is physical, detactable, and exist.S
