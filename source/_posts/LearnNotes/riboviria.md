## Riboviria

Riboviria is a realm of viruses that includes all viruses that use a homologous RNA-dependent polymerase for **replication**.
It includes:
1. RNA viruses that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp).
2. Reverse-transcribing viruses (with either RNA or DNA genomes) that encode an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase(RdDp).

RdRp and RdDp enzymes are essential for replicating the viral genome and transcribing viral genes into messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of viral proteins.

Riboviria likely **descended from non-viral elements** that encode reverse transcriptase. It has **few prokaryotic viruses**, and includes **most eukaryotic viruses**.

*[RdRp]: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
*[RdDp]: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase

Well known species are included:
- coronaviruses, ebola virus, HIV, influenza viruses, rabies virus, and Tobacco mosaic virus.

## Characteristics

1. RdRp: Based on the Baltimore classification system:
    - positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses
    - negative sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses
    - double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA)

Viral mRNA is translated by the **host cell's ribosomes to produce viral proteins**. In order to produce more viruses, viral RNA-dependent polymerases use copies of the viral genome as templates to replicate the viral genome.
- For +ssRNA viruses, an intermediate dsRNA genome is created from which +ssRNA is synthesized from the negative strand.
- For -ssRNA viruses, genomes are synthesized from complementary positive sense strands. dsRNA viruses replicate their genomes from mRNA by synthesizing a complementary negative sense strand to form genomic dsRNA. For dsDNA-RT viruses, pregenomic RNA created from the cccDNA is retrotranscribed into new dsDNA genomes. For +ssRNA-RT viruses, the genome is replicated from the integrated genome. After replication and translation, the genome and the viral proteins are assembled into complete virions, which then leave the host cell.
