## A Tissue-Mapped Axolotl De Novo Transcriptome Enables Identification of Limb Regeneration Factors

cite: Bryant, Donald M., et al. "A tissue-mapped axolotl de novo transcriptome enables identification of limb regeneration factors." Cell reports 18.3 (2017): 762-776.

*[cirbp]: cold-inducible RNA-binding protein  



## Abstract

- ***cirbp*** and ***kazald1*** as highly expressed and enriched in ***blastemas***.
- ***cirbp*** palys and cytoprotective role in limb regeneration.

It also verified the function of ***cirbp*** and ***kazald1*** by modify their expression.


## Discussion
- ***cirbp*** is similar to RBM3
- both cirbp and RBM3 are response to specific stressors (cold shock, hypoxia, UV...).
- ***cirbp*** prevent progenitor cell from death.
- ***cirbp*** are also detected in ealry and later stage, which may serves relatively undifferentiated and will be eliminated as the regenerating digits are sculpted.
-  fus mRNA may regulated by the cirbp

### Kazald1
- reducing the expression of kazald1 result deformed arm
- It's a marker of the cancer cell
