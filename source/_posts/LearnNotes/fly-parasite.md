## Parasites in Drosophila

In drosophila, we expect that it has wide range of parasites

Genome-wide study shows that some SNP could help D. melanogaster to resist viruses like Drosophila C and D. Melanogaster-specific Sigma viruse[^Magwire_12]

Generally, the Toll, Imd, Jak-Stat, and JNK pathways are involved in different kinds of parasite affection. The humoral response model shows that secreted or membrane-bound receptors recognize antigens and activate NF-κB TF to produce the antimicrobial peptides[^Magwire_12]. In signaling pathways Toll pathway and the Imd pathway[^D_Gregorio_02], and the Jak-Stat and JNK pathways[^Boutros_02] seem to play an important role in microbes immunity.

### TEs

Transcriptional silencing of mobile elements could be acheived via the ==PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway==. piRNA which contains target sequence paired with PIWI fanuky proteins *Piwi*, *Aub*, and *Ago3* could resist the transcription of the TEs[^Brennecke_08]. In germ cells, piRNA maturation occurs in nuage through three pathways; the de **novo biogenesis pathway, the ping-pong cycle (i.e., piRNA amplification pathway), and phasing**[^Sato_20].

> The key difference between DNA transposons and retrotransposons is that DNA transposons are mobile genetic elements that move from one place to another in the genome by using a cut and paste mechanism, while retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that move from one place to another in the genome by using copy and paste mechanism.

|Brad Ericson, 2016. Nora Virus from D. melanogaster[^Ericson_16]|

Previous studies show that some **peptidoglycan recognition proteins** and **antimicrobial peptides** from **Toll** and **Imd** pathway may responsible for **sigma virus** infection in *D. melanogaster*[^Carpenter_09][^Tsai_08]. Gene ***ref(2)P***[^Longdon_12][^Magwire_11] which related to selective autophagy, ***CHKov1***, and ***CHKov2***, other resistance factors[^Magwire_12] may work together to increase the resistance of the sigma virus.

DCV can increase the mortality of the flies. ***hopscotch*** mutant makes *D. melanogaster* more vulnerable to DCV which indicates that the Jak-Stat pathway is important to flies against DCV[^Dostert_05][^Kemp_13]. Besides, ***pastrel*** was also connected to DCV mortality[^Magwire_12]. Though the **RNAi mechanism** in DCV defense is unclear, it could potentially play an important role in virus resistance. Similarly, RNAi related mechanism, including ***piwi***, vasa intronic gene (***vig***), aubergine (***aub***), armitage (***armi***), ***Rm62***, ***r2d2*** and Argonaute2 (***AGO2***) as having vital roles in responding to Drosophila X Virus (DXV)[^Zambon_06]. RNAi pathway initiation denpends on the dsRNA produced by genome or RNA viruses.

Others like the **picoran-like Nora virus** could evade the effects of RNAi, Toll, and Jak-STAT pathways[^Habayeb_09]. They studied the genes ***AGO2***, ***Dicer-2***, ***r2d2***, which could help the ***RISC*** assembly[^Liu_Q_03], from siRNA pathway; ***piwi1*** and ***piwi2*** from piRNA pathway, ***Dicer-1*** from miRNA pathway, ***pelle*** from Toll pathway, and ***hop*** from Jak-Stat pathway to show that those 5 commonly involved in viral infection doesn't affect the activity of Nora virus. But flies are able to clean viruses by themselves in low titer infection experiments.


Though, RNA interference played an important role in anti-virus mechanism, some reseachs also show Toll, Imd, and Jak/STAT also activated to against viruses[^Dostert_C_05][^Zambon_R_05][^Costa_A_09].

*Pseudomonas entomophila* was isolated from a wild-caught fly. Larvae activated Imd, Jak-Stat, and JNK pathways to response the infection of *P. entomophila1*. Mutanted *relish* from Imd pathway could increasing the mortality[^Vodovar_05] and vise vursis(Liehl et al., 2006).

*Wolbachia*: A well-described effect of Wolbachia infection is cytoplasmic incompatibility. It describes embryonic lethality resulting from mitotic defects. Wolbachia-induced alteration of ***Hira*** expression causes cytoplasmic incompatibility[^Zheng_11a]. On the other hand, *Wolbachia* infection could increase the activaty of the Imd pathway and antimicrobial peptides[^Zheng_11b]. Wolbachia could also boost female flies fecundity[^Weeks_07], increase individuals resistance to some RNA viruses[^Hedges_08][^Osborne_09][^Teixeira_08], and fungal[^Panteleev_07]. A model show that wolbachia could mediates host RNAi machinery to resistance DCV[^Hedges_12]. Other studies show that it failed to response some other pathogens[^Rottschaefer_12][^Teixeira_08][^Unckless_11][^Wong_11]

> Flies mount a melanotic encapsulation response against the wasp eggs, whereby the egg is recognized as foreign, circulating plasmatocytes are activated and migrate to the wasp egg, the lymph gland (the hematopoietic organ) begins producing new specialized hemocytes termed lamellocytes, the lamellocytes form successive cellular layers on top of the plasmatocytes, the hemocytes consolidate around the wasp egg via septate junctions, and inner cells in the capsule release free radicals and melanin inside the capsule to kill the developing wasp[^Keebaugh_14]


## Innate immunity of Drosophila

### Hemocytes

The immune cell circulating along blood cells within flies are hemocytes and there are three types of them and Plasmatocytes is the most common hemocytes (95%). It resembles mammalian phagocytes and like macrophages. Hemocytes could be recruited to epithelia tumors which usually generated by mutant for apical/basal polarity genes like *scrib* (*scr*), *lethal giant larvae* (*lgl*), or *discs large* (*dlg*) while expressing drosophila oncogene *dRas1*[^Pastor-a_08][^Gonzalez_C_13]. Apical/basal polarity genes mutated cell usually are eliminated by apoptosis through JNK pathways (A part of FOXO signaling pathway in KEGG) [^Rudrapatna_12]. However, apical/basal polarity genes mutated cell co-expressed *dRas1* promotes *MMP* expression, basement membrane degradation and invasion instead of apoptosis along with the activation of JNK pathway [^Brumby_A_03][^Pagliarini_R_03]. Though tumor may can recruit hemocytes, but basement membrane disruption in the absence of tumors by overexpression of MMP2 is enough to attracting them, too[^Bangi_E_13]. For against tumor, JNK pathway could promote the secretion of JAK-STAT activating cytokines (*Upd* ligands) and cause the proliferation of hymocytes[^Bangi_E_13].
Another inflammatory response is TNF introduced and which could response to microbial infection, tissue damage and malignant cells[^Waters_J_13]. *Egr* is the TNF in drosophila and which is needed to clearing the *crib*^−/−^ or *lgl*^−/−^ cells from the epithelium[^Igaki_T_09]. Tumor Associated Hemocytes which infiltrated into tumor tissue also show high expression of *egr* and it is required to induce JNK signaling and MMP expression[^Cordero_J_10]. Some *H. pylori* could inject virulence factor *CagA* protein into gastric carcinoma[^Hatakeyama_M_08]. *CagA* expressed in wing disc epithelium could recruit hymocytes [^Wandler_A_12].

### Toll Signaling Pathway

Toll is one of the most important signaling pathway for flies to against microbes. In human, Toll like receptor could activate the MAPK signaling pathway and genes like NFκB, IRF (interferon regulatory factors)[^Rakoff-N_09]. Some reseachs show that innate immunity response could also affects the migratory potential of epithelia cells[^Wang_J_03][^Merrell_M_06].

In human, the best-characterized TLR microbial ligands are as follows:
- TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6: bacterial lipoproteins and lipotechoic acid and fungal zymosan;
- TLR3: double-stranded RNA;
- TLR4: lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) from Gram-negative bacteria;
- TLR5: bacterial flagellin;
- TLR7 and TLR8: and single-stranded RNA
- TLR9 unmethylated CpG motifs present in DNA that function;
- TLR11: a profilin-like molecule from the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii;

>In addition to microbial ligands, an increasing number of endogenous ligands are being reported as candidate stimulators of TLRs, in particular of TLR2 and TLR4. These include heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, endoplasmin, HSPB8 and α-crystallin A chain)7,8,9,10,11,12,13, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)14,15, uric acid crystals16,17, surfactant protein A18, and various products of the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin19, heparan sulphate20, biglycan21, fibrinogen22, oligosaccharides of hyaluronan23 and hyaluronan breakdown fragments24,25,26.

In drosophila, gram positive bacterial or fungal infection could activate the Toll signaling pathway and produce antimicrobial peptide gene *Drosomycin* (*Drs*) through activating NFκB related protein Dorsal-related immune factor (*DIF*), a transcription factor[^Rutschmann_S_00]. In verses, Imd responds to gram negative bacteria and secretes *Diptericin* (*DptA*/*DptB*)[^J_Hoffmann_02]. Transposons inserted *GNBP1* failed transcription/stability leading to low tolerance in Gram positive bacteria infection[^Gobert_v_03].

### Imd

General review: [The Drosophila Imd Signaling Pathway; 2014](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/192/8/3455.short)[^Myllymäki_H_14]


*[AMP]: Antimicrobial peptides

!!!note Why Imd is so important:

Imd (mmune deficiency) pathway which could activate 3^rd^ *Drosopila* NFκB protein, Relish[^Dushay_M_96], to activate different kind AMP expression[^Lemaitre_B_95].


The first step for activating Imd signaling pathway is recognizing microbes by Peptidoglycan-recognition proteins (*PGRP*)[^Werner_T_00]. *PGRP* family could be a intracellular, extracellular, or transmembrane proteins.
- PGRP-LD: unclear
- PGRP-LC: transmembrane receptor and binds  a meso-diaminopimelic acid–type PGN found on Gram-negative bacteria and some certain G^+^ Bacteria like Bacillus spp.[^Kaneko_T_04]. It is the principal receptor for activate the Imd signaling pathway[^Choe_K_02].
    - PGRP-LCx: recognizes polymeric PGN[^Kaneko_T_04].
    - PGRP-LCa: Not bind PGN directly, but acts as a coreceptor with PGRP-LCx to bind monomeric PGN fragmetns(tracheal cytotoxin, or TCT)[^Lim_J_06].
- PGRP-LE: cytoplasmic PGRP-LE could interact and activate Imd signaling pathway directly[^Kaneko_T_06].
    - Short from: secreted and binds PGN in the hemolymph[^Takehana_A_02]; It might help to present the PGN to *PGRP-LC*. It can introduce autophagy[^Schmidt_R_08].
    - Full form: in the cytoplasm and recognize TCT fragments[^Lim_J_06].
- ==PGRP-LF==: transmembrane protein, acts as a inhibitor by binds with *PGRP-LC* and prevent its dimerization[^Persson_C_07].
- PGRP-LA: positively regulate the Imd pathway in barrier epithelia[^Gendrin_M_13].
- PGRP-LB, PGRP-SC1A, PGRP-SC1B, and PGRP-SC2 have an amidase activity and are shown to play somewhat redundant roles in downregulating the Imd pathway during a systemic response[^Myllymäki_H_14].

Imd was cleaved by *Dredd*, which removes 30-aa N-terminal fragment and create a bind site to *lap2*, which can then K63-ubiquitinate Imd[^Meinander_A_12][^Paquette_N_10]. After that, Tab2/Tak1 complex is recruited and Drosophila IKK complex was phosphorylated[^Lu_Y_01][^Kleino_A_05]. At the end of the Imd signaling pathway, *Relish* was phosphorylated on multiple sites at N terminus by *IKK* complex[^Silverman_N_00]. Among them, S528 and S529 phosphorylation are crucial to recruitment RNA PoII[^Silverman_N_00][^Ertürk-Hasdemir_D_09]. C-terminal (Rel-49) remains in cytoplasm and N-terminal (Rel-68) form as a dimer and translocates into nucleus to activate transcription[^Delaney_J_06].

Ubiquiting could also regulates the Imd signaling pathways, too. *dUSP36/Scny* accumulation prevent actviate form, K63-ubiquitinated Imd and promotes its K48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation[^Thevenon_D_09]. Similarly, deubiquitinating enzyme *faf* could prevent Imd ubiquitin[^Yagi_Y_13]. RING-finger protein POSH could degrade *Tak1*[^Tsuda_M_05]. Deubiquitinating *CYLD* could also negatively regulated Imd by interact with IKK[^Tsichritzis_T_07]. Relish activate is relied on degradation by SCF complex[^Khush_R_02] and might promoted by ubiquitin-binding protein dRYBP[^Aparicio_R_13]. Caspar is also inhibits the Dredd-mediated cleavage of Relish[^Kim_M_06].

Transcription factor: *Imd* pathway is negatively regulated by transcriptional factor *zfh1* and the *AP-1/Stat92E* complex. *Zfh1* could down-regulating dramatically in vitro but not quit clear in vivo[^Goto_A_08][^Kim_T_05][^Myllymäki_H_13]. The JNK pathway TF AP-1, Stat92E, and Dsp1 thant bands to the *Relish* target genes.
Fead back gene *prik* could regulate the Imd pathway, too[^Kallio_J_05]. And it is needed for the normal tolerance of gut macrobiota[^Lhocine_N_08]. Caudal is the intestinal homeobox gene and expressed in adult gut[^Buchon_N_13]. Silencing of it could cause AMPs constantly expression[^Ryu_J_08].

20-Hydroxyecdysterone (ecdysone) is needed for the phagocytic of hymocytes[^Regan_J_13] and may directly effect the Imd signaling pathway[^Rus_F_13].

!!! Others related Imd
    Genes like *PGRPs* and *Relish* from Imd and seom *AMP* are increased during aging[^Landis_G_04][^Seroude_L_02][^Pletcher_S_02]. In calorie-resistance diet experiment shows that Relish mutanted flies could live longer[^Valtonen_T_10]. On the other hand, over-expression *Relish* related AMPs could induce neurodegeneratetion[^Cao_Y_10].

### Reactive Oxygen Species

> Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a collective term that includes both oxygen radicals, such as superoxide (O~2~^·−^), hydroxyl (OH^·^), peroxyl (RO~2~^·^), and hydroperoxyl (HO~2~^·^) radicals, and certain nonradical oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and ozone (O~3~), that can be converted easily to into radicals[^Halliwell_B_89]. ROS are also produced during normal metabolism and are involved in enzymatic reactions, mitochondrial electron transport, signal transduction, activation of nuclear transcription factors, gene expression, and the antimicrobial action of neutrophils and macrophages.
>
> This reducing environment is maintained by the action of antioxidant enzymes and substances, such as superoxide dismutase (**SOD**), catalase (**cat**), glutathione peroxidase (**Gpxl**/**Gtpx**), glutathione (**GSH**), ascorbate (**V~C~**), α-tocopherol ( **V~E~**), and thioredoxin (**Prx4**). Alterations in the redox state and depletion of antioxidants by exposure to oxidants lead to oxidative stress and resultant oxidative injury.
>
> The oxygen molecule (dioxygen; O~2~) qualifies as a radical because (in its ground state) it has two unpaired electrons. From a quantum mechanical standpoint, the electron spin quantum number for ground state dioxygen is three (i.e., oxygen is a triplet species). Since most stable organic molecules are in singlet state (electron spin quantum number equal to one), the reaction of ground state oxygen with cellular constituents is “spin forbidden” even though oxygen is considered a powerful oxidizing agent. To overcome spin restriction, oxygen prefers to accept electrons one at a time, and the sequential addition of electrons leads to formation of ROS. Acceptance of a single electron by an oxygen molecule forms O~2~^·−^, which has one unpaired electron. Superoxide itself has limited reactivity. It is capable of inactivating few enzymes directly. The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is one of the enzymes shown to be a direct target for O~2~^·−^ attack[^Zhang_Y_90].

!!! infor Source of ROS
    The main source of ROS comes from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), and myeloperoxidase (MPO)

- Important function in innate immunity[^C_Dahlgren_99]
- signaling molecules: H~2~O~2~ regulating NFκB, MAPK pathways[^J_Zhang_16]
- It could produced by:
    - Mitochondria[^J_J_Perry_10]
    - NADPH oxidase[^J_L_Meitzler_14] (DUOX)
    -  Peroxisomes (which contain enzymes that produce H~2~O~2~ e.g. polyamine oxidase)[^M_Fransen_12].

Increasing intestine epithelia cells calcium could increase the ROS level and it could be rescude by EGTA or diphenylene iodonium (DPI)[^Ha_E_05].  Some oncogenes activation could increasing ROS[^A_Maya_Mendoza_15][^M_T_Park_14]. ROS oxidize dNTPs which is needed for polymerase[^Y_Meng_18][^D_Graindorge_15]. On the other hand, ROX may slower the replication speed[^K_Somyajit_17], as a physical obstacle[^Y_Sedletska_13] and broken it to form fragments[^P_Kotsantis_18]. *NRF2* deficiency could also increase ROS because *NRF2* TF promotes the expression of oxidative stress related genes[^S_Zhou_13].

#### DUOX (dual oxidase)

*[DUOX]: dual oxidase

Duox is a kind of NADPH oxidase which could catalase NADPH into ROS (H~2~O~2~)[^Lee_KA_14]. Minor infection through food microbe-contaminated food could kill DUOX-deficiency flies but doesn't change the Nox/NFκB deficiency flies[^Ha_E_05]. In verses, Immune-regulated catalase (*Irc*) could consume ROS and work with Duox to keep the concentration of ROS in balance[^Ha_EM_05].IRC-RNAi fly would have a high level of ROS and it could be rescued by DUOX-RNAi
