### Without the Wnt

From the KEGG pathway map, we can know that a receptor complex is composed by ***LRP*** and ***frizzled***. On the downside of the receptor, there is a degradation complex (grey arear on the map which name is scaffold) which mad by ***Axin***, ***CKI***, ***GSK3B***, and the most important two proteins: ***$\beta$-catenin*** and ***APC***. ***CKI*** and ***GSK3B*** both phosphorylate the ***$\beta$-catenin*** and then it was degradation by proteosome. On the other side, which is in the nuclear, protein ***TCF*** and ***LEF*** formed a complex and bind on the DNA which responsible for transcription of the genes. But  ***groucho*** bind with ***TCF/LEF*** to prohibit the release of DNA.

### With the present of Wnt

When the receptor complex activated by ***Wnt***, Dishevelled protein (***Dvl***) and degradation complex are recruited by receptor complex. In this way, the ***$\beta$-catenin*** is not ubiquinated and released into the nuclear. Then, ***$\beta$-catenin*** releases the ***groucho*** and bind with ***TCF*** and started to bind the DNA. In this way, wnt signal pathway regulated genes are activated and expressed.


## Abnormal in Wnt


Intestine stem cells is a group of fast poliferation cell because the intestine epithelial cells only last for 4 days. Lost of tha ***APC*** could cause the fail of ***$\beta$-catenin*** phosphorylation and leading the constant of gene transcription (90% of human colon cancer).

over-expression of wild-type Wts has relatively little effect on wing growth in wild-type flies, but can suppress the over-growth phenotypes associated with mutation of upstream tumor suppressors that activate Yki[^Sun_11].
