excerpt: "The Wnt signaling pathway is a pathway that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate determination during embryonic development and in adult tissues. Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in various diseases, including cancer. It is studied to understand the mechanisms of cell signaling and to develop targeted therapies. <a title='ChatGPT3'>Who said this?</a>"

### Without the Wnt

From the KEGG pathway map, we can know that a receptor complex is composed by ***LRP*** and ***frizzled***. On the downside of the receptor, there is a degradation complex (grey arear on the map which name is scaffold) which mad by ***Axin***, ***CKI***, ***GSK3B***, and the most important two proteins: ***$\beta$-catenin*** and ***APC***. ***CKI*** and ***GSK3B*** both phosphorylate the ***$\beta$-catenin*** and then it was degradation by proteosome. On the other side, which is in the nuclear, protein ***TCF*** and ***LEF*** formed a complex and bind on the DNA which responsible for transcription of the genes. But  ***groucho*** bind with ***TCF/LEF*** to prohibit the release of DNA.

### With the present of Wnt

When the receptor complex activated by ***Wnt***, Dishevelled protein (***Dvl***) and degradation complex are recruited by receptor complex. In this way, the ***$\beta$-catenin*** is not ubiquinated and released into the nuclear. Then, ***$\beta$-catenin*** releases the ***groucho*** and bind with ***TCF*** and started to bind the DNA. In this way, wnt signal pathway regulated genes are activated and expressed.


## Abnormal in Wnt


Intestine stem cells is a group of fast poliferation cell because the intestine epithelial cells only last for 4 days. Lost of tha ***APC*** could cause the fail of ***$\beta$-catenin*** phosphorylation and leading the constant of gene transcription (90% of human colon cancer).

over-expression of wild-type Wts has relatively little effect on wing growth in wild-type flies, but can suppress the over-growth phenotypes associated with mutation of upstream tumor suppressors that activate Yki[^Sun_11].
