## Allosteric Enzyme

It is a class of regulated with distinct regulatory and catalytic subunit.

***Aspartate Transcarbamoylase*** (***ATCase***)
  - Catalyzes the first step of the biosynthesis of pyrimidine
    $Carbamoyl\ phosphate + Aspartate \overset{ATCase}{\rightleftharpoons}$
    $N^ {_ -} carbamoylaspartate + pi \to ... \to CTP$
  - CTP: Cytidine Triphosphate
  - In the experiment, CTP$\uparrow$ cause the ATCase activity$\downarrow$
  - CTP has no chemical similar structure to the substrates of ATCase
  - CTP does not interact with ATCase

## The experiment of Distance migration
- When ATCase separated on the sucrose gradient
  - purified as a single peak
  - can both bind with CTP and substrates and inhibited by CTP

- When **pretreated** ATCase separated on the sucrose gradient
  - two peaks.
  - One can only bind the CTP
  - Another can only bind the substrates

That means ATCase contains two types of subunits:
  - Regulatory subunit: bind CTP
  - Catalytic subunit: bind substrates

This is what the **Allosteric Enzyme** which has a catalytic site distinct from the regulatory site.

**Terminology**

*Allos* = other
*ster* = structure

## subunits of ATCase
It has six subunits organized into three dimers, six regulatory subunits that are organized into three dimers.
When binding with the substrate (asperate), it changes conformation from T to R state.
- T: Inactive state, predominant without substrates
- R: activate, stabilized by substrate binding

### Homotropic allosteric behavior

homotropic regulation:

Example:
Set the ATCase with two substrates:
- Carbamoyl phosphate: constant concentration.
- Aspartate: increasing concentration

Result: it is a **sigmoidal** curve (S shape).

Example2:
The same condition as above but only with the catalytic subunit of ATcase:

We obtain a **hyperbolic** curve which looks like a curve that we would get with a Michaelian enzyme.


Hypothesis:
- The Allosteric protein are oligomeric (made of several subunits in a symmetrical fashion)
- Each subunit contains only one binding site for any given ligand.
- The enzyme can exist in at least 2 states (such as ***T*** and ***R***)


Another model: KNF model
KNF model assumes a sequential progression from ***T*** to ***R***.
1. **Single T conformation**: No ligand bound to the enzyme.
2. **Conformation Changed**: One ligand binds to one subunit
3. Conformation change transmitted to the neighboring vacant subunit

## Enzyme-limited reaction

- Substrate-limited reaction:
  - The speed of the reaction decided by the supply of the substrate
- Enzyme-limited reaction:
  - The activity of the enzyme is low
  untile the enzyme was activated by some specific effector

### What is the Enzyme-limited reaction
$Fructose-6P +ATP \overset{PFK-1}{\longrightarrow} Fructose-1,6-P + ADP$

Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)
$$
\frac{[Fructose-1,6-P][ADP]}{[Fructose-6-P][ATP]} = R_ f
$$

||Vivo|Vitro|
|:-|:-:|:-:|
|R~f~|0.04|250|

The ratio difference between Vivo and Vitro indicates that the PFK-1 was in a real low activity under normal conditions.

### Regulations

Allosteric regulation:
  - Allosteric regulators usually reflect cell metabolic state
  - Fasta regulation (a few milliseconds)

Reversible convalent modification:
  - IE-phosphorylation
  - Slower than allosteric (a few seconds)

Transcriptional regulation
  - The slowest form of regulation

## PFK-1 regulation

### ATP
ATP is an inhibitor of the PFK-1
Low [ATP]: The curve of PFK-1 is hyperbolic:
  - A very low concentration of PFK-1 could have a high level of activity.

High [ATP]: The curve of PFK-1 is sigmoidal:
  - The activities of PFK-1 are low until its concentration is higher than a specific level.

Physiological significance: PFK-1 is not needed when the ATP is sufficient.

### AMP
AMP is an activator of the PFK-1.

As a result, the ratio of ATP and AMP could regulate the activity of the PFK-1.

$\frac{[ATP]}{[AMP]}$ is high:
    - **High energy state**
    - ATP is abundant
    - PFK-1's activity is suppressed.

$\frac{[ATP]}{[AMP]}$ is low:
    - **Low energy state**
    - ATP is a deficiency
    - PFK-1's activity is increased.

### Why not ADP
ADP is a poor indicator of the cell energy state indicator.
Because:
$$
2 ADP \overset{Adenylate \ kinase}{\longrightarrow} ATP + AMP
$$

On the other hand, the AMP is more sensible to the ADP.
concentration: $[AMP] < [ADP] < [ATP]$
changing scale: $AMP > ADP > ATP$ (sensitivity)

### others

Citrate inhibited PFK-1 by enhancing the ATP inhibitor effect.

#### PFK-2

$$
fructose-6-bisphosphate +ATP \overset{PFK-2}{\longrightarrow} fructose-2,6-bisphosphate + ADP
$$

In the liver, the ATP is always high, the fructose-2,6-biphosphate played the role of ATP.

The fructose-2,6-bisphosphate dampened the effect of ATP on PFK-1.

PFK-2 contains:
  1. kinase domain: phosphorylation of the substrates
  2. phosphate domain: dephosphorylation the produces

The function of the two domain was regulated by other factors and indirectly control the activity of PFK-1

**PFK-2 in liver**
PFK-2 is regulated by the [Glu]~Blood~.

We know that: $[Glu]_ {Blood} \approx [Glu]_ {Liver} $

- When [Glu~Blood~] is high, Glu stats to be metabolized,
  As a result, a **feed-forward stimulation** occurs:
  - $\uparrow[F-6-P] \to \ \uparrow PFK-2 \to \ \uparrow[F-2,6-P] \uparrow Glycolysis$

- When [Glu~Blood~] is low, Glu stats to be metabolized,
  - $\uparrow FBPase$ activity
  - $\downarrow F-2,6-BP$
  - $\downarrow PFK-1$ activity
  - Glucagon -> G~s~ -> convert ATP to cAMP -> PKA -> PFK-2(phosphate and inhibitate) -> PFK-1 decrease


## Liver

When The [Glu]~Blood~ is high: [ATP] is high, too:

==Muscle==:
1. Hexokinase was prohibited (by G-6-P)
2. activity of PFK-1 $\downarrow$ (by ATP)
3. Glu was taken by the liver and be converted into Glycogen and fat.


==Liver==:
1. Glucokinase:
    - Not inhibited by glucose-6-P
    - High K~m~
2. Activities of Glycolysis $\downarrow$ (by ATP)
3. Glycogen and fatty acid synthesis are activated.
