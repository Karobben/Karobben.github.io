## What is behavior research

Behavioral research, often referred to as behavior science, is the scientific study of the behavior of human beings and animals. It involves the systematic collection and analysis of data in order to understand and explain how individuals behave in certain situations.

Behavioral research spans multiple disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, neurology, and even computer science, and it encompasses a variety of specific fields of study, such as behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and behavioral neuroscience.

Here are a few reasons why we study behavior:
1. ***Understand Mechanisms***: Understanding the mechanisms that underlie behavior can give us insights into why individuals act the way they do. This can involve studying the brain and nervous system to understand the physiological basis of behavior.

2. ***Predict Behavior***: By understanding the factors that influence behavior, researchers can predict how individuals will behave in different circumstances. This has applications in many fields, from marketing (predicting consumer behavior) to public health (predicting adherence to health guidelines).

3. ***Change Behavior***: Once we understand and can predict behavior, we can also try to change it. This can involve designing interventions to promote beneficial behaviors or discourage harmful ones.

4. ***Evaluate Interventions***: Behavioral research is also used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to change behavior.

## How to study behaviors

As for how we study behaviors, it often involves the following steps:

1. ***Observation***: The first step is often to observe the behavior in its natural context, in order to get a sense of what is happening and to generate hypotheses.

2. ***Measurement***: Researchers then need to find a way to measure the behavior in a systematic and reliable way. This can involve anything from timing a rat in a maze, to counting the number of times a bird performs a specific action, to administering questionnaires to human participants.

3. ***Experimentation***: Once the behavior has been measured, researchers can conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. This typically involves manipulating one or more variables and observing the effect on the behavior.

4. ***Analysis***: The data collected in the experiment is then analyzed, often using statistical methods, to determine whether the observed effects are statistically significant.

5. ***Interpretation and Publication***: The results are then interpreted in light of the original hypotheses, and the study is usually written up and published in a scientific journal, so that other researchers can evaluate and build on the findings.

Overall, behavioral research is a vast field that offers insights into the complexities of behavior and provides a foundation for making predictions and interventions in various sectors of life and society.

## Common things we can do with in behavior analysis

1. ***Social network analysis***: Consider each animal as a node and an interaction as an edge in a network. You can use graph analysis techniques to identify which animals have the most interactions (central nodes), which ones tend to interact with each other (clusters), and whether the pattern of interactions changes over time.

2. ***Behavioral change over time***: Analyze the animals' behaviors (like wing extensions or movement patterns) over time. Look for patterns or triggers for specific behaviors - do they happen more frequently at certain times or after specific interactions?

3. ***Collective behavior***: You can look at the group-level behaviors. For example, if the group tends to move together, you can calculate the polarization of the group, which is a measure of how much the animals' movement directions align with each other. If the group tends to stay together, you can calculate the nearest neighbor distance or the density of the group, which are measures of the group's cohesion.

4. ***Individual vs. group behavior***: Try comparing individual behaviors to the group behavior. Are there certain individuals that often initiate group movements? Are there individuals that often behave differently than the group?

5. ***Correlation between movement and behavior***: Investigate if there's a correlation between the movement of an animal (speed, acceleration, etc.) and its specific behaviors like wing extensions. Does a specific behavior trigger a change in movement or vice versa?

6. ***Response to stimuli***: If your data includes any events or stimuli (like changes in the environment or the appearance of food or predators), you can analyze how these affect the animals' behavior. Do these events trigger specific behaviors or changes in interaction patterns?

To quantify the interactions, you could count the number of interactions each animal has, the frequency of interactions, the average duration of interactions, etc. You could also quantify the result of each interaction - for example, does one animal tend to move away after interacting with another?

You would need to use statistical methods and possibly machine learning techniques to perform these analyses, depending on the complexity of your data and the questions you're trying to answer. You might also find it helpful to visualize your data, both to help you understand it and to communicate your results to others.


## Something more we may can do

1. ***Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis***: You can use supervised learning if you have labeled data, or unsophisticated learning if you don't, to discover patterns in the data and make predictions about future behavior based on past data. For example, you can try to predict when and where certain behaviors will occur, or predict the outcome of interactions based on their initial conditions.

2. ***Multivariate Behavioral Analysis***: Investigate the relationships between different behaviors. For example, does a wing extension by one animal often lead to a similar action by another animal? Or does a particular movement pattern often precede or follow certain interactions? These patterns might not be visible in a univariate analysis of individual behaviors, but may emerge when looking at multiple behaviors together.

3. ***Complex Network Analysis***: Go beyond basic social network analysis and use techniques from complex network analysis. For example, you might look at motifs (recurring patterns of interactions), centrality measures (which animals are most central or influential in the network), community structure (groups of animals that interact more with each other than with the rest of the group), etc.

4. ***Spatio-temporal Analysis***: Study the behavior of the group as a function of both space and time. For example, do the animals exhibit different behaviors or interactions in different parts of the container? Or at different times?

5. ***Comparative Analysis***: If you have data for different groups of animals, you might compare their behaviors. Are there consistent differences between groups, or between the same group at different times?

6. ***Ethological Modeling***: Based on your data, you could develop models of animal behavior. These models could be mathematical, computational, or conceptual, and they could help you better understand the principles underlying the behaviors you observe.

7. ***Fractional Order Statistics***: This is a newer branch of statistics that can be used to model complex systems, it might be helpful if the data shows heavy-tailed distributions or long-range correlations.
