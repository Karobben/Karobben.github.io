## Stem Cells: An Insider's Guide
Author: Paul Knoepfler

Just as the name of this book, it more reads like a guide, or, a collection of well-sorted and organized blog posts. It does not mean it is informal. It just this book much similar to the free-style of texts on the internet. You can really read it without too much of, like when you have to concentrate and being critical to read a paper or a STEM textbook, to read.

The author noticed that there are lots of steroid-type or prejudice opinions on stem cells most contributed to the commercial-advertises of stem cell therapy, though its potentials and probabilities are worth it. So, for correcting the name of the stem cells, Dr. Paul Knoepfler from U.C. Davis gave his opinions and advice on how people should, especially non-specialists and people who are the potential of stem cell treatment patients, respond to this area, for example, how to acquire more information to do self-teaching, should they take this therapy, how can companies make tricks and lies to dramatize it, what kind of results are they come with, and most importantly, how this industry works so people can understand that the result may not fit their expectation very well.
