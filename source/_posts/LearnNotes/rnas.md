description: "Different kinds of RNA"
excerpt: "Regulatory RNA refers to non-coding RNA molecules that play a role in regulating gene expression. These molecules can control gene expression by interacting with DNA and/or mRNA, influencing the process of transcription and translation. Examples of regulatory RNA include microRNAs, siRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs. <a title='ChatGPT'>Who sad this?</a>"

## Regulatory RNA

miRNA, piRNA, siRNA, lncRNA

- miRNA
    A kind of small RNA. Short RNA  which pair with mRNA regions and target them for degradation.
- siRNAs
    A kind of small RNA.
- piRNA
    A kind of small RNA. Similar to miRNA.
- LncRNA
    lncRNA associated with X chromosome inactivation. Some other lncRNA have been found associated with regulation of stem cell pluripotency and cell division.
- Enhancer RNA
    transcribed from enhancers which could up-regulate teh transcription of the genes
- prokaryotes RNA
    sRNA
- circulating RNA
    ?


!!! note Small RNA
    Saml RNA are short (~18-30nt), non-coding RNA molecules which can regulate gene expression. They can interfering the expression (RNAi) or increase the expression (RNAa). There are three main classes of small RNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs), siRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs).
Samll RNA like miRNA may directly regulate 30% of genes in human[^Lewis_B_05]. A review from 2009 elaborately talked the funciton of miRNA plaied important roles in gene regulation, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, metabolism, defense, development, and disease[^Zhang_C_09].

## miRNA

> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short(~22-nt), **endogenously-initiated** non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally control gene expression via either **translational repression** or **mRNA degradation**. Meanwhile, miRNA itself is coordinatively **modulated by multifarious effectors** when carrying out basic functions, such as SNP, miRNA editing, methylation and circadian clock. it constitute nearly 1% of all predicted genes in nematodes, flies and mammals
    1. most of the known miRNAs are encoded as polycistronic transcripts
    2. considerable number of miRNAs are highly conserved in sequences among different organisms
    3. miRNAs tend to target and regulate a set of mRNAs instead of a specific mRNA substrate
    4. miRNA pathway is an ancient regulatory mechanism evolved before the divergence of multicellular and unicellular organisms[^Zhao_Tao_07]
    5. viral miRNAs do not seem to share significant homology
