## Structure and Function of Collagen

- extracellular proteins that provide rigidity and strength to many tissues
- Large bundles of triple helices
- Gly-X-Y

![Seqlogo graph of the Gly-x-y pattern](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/17/4uaLU1.png)

Alanine - Glycine substitute: ***A*** is hydrophobically contributed to &alpha;-helix composed.

Hydroxyproline...

- stabilized by cross-helix backbone hydrogen bonds
- large bundles of triple helices: A right-handed trimer of left-handed helices.
- Gly-X-Y Pattern: X is mostly proline and many of the Y is hydroxyproline (Gly-Pro-Hyp)


Glycine:
- No side chain: Closer the &alpha;-helix
- Hydrophobic: Folding to the center of the helix by hydrophobic effect

Alanine (replacing to Glycine):
- larger than Glycine but could still work similarly to Glycine

Prolein $ Hydroxyproline:
- pull out of the strand
- hydroxyproline work with water

Proline hydrolyzation was carried by Proline hydroxylase and required V~c~ as co-factor.

$$
Proline + 2-Oxoglutarate + O_ 2 + Fe^ {2+}\overset{Proline hydroxylase}{\longrightarrow} Hydroxyproline + Succinate + CO_ 2 + Fe^ {3+}
$$
$$
V_ c + Fe^ {3+} \to Dehydroascorbate + Fe^ {2+}
$$


- Collagen is stabilized by cross-helix backbone hydrogen bonds

PS: Proline is often disturbing the structure of the &alpha;-helix. But why is proline's favorite in the triple &alpha;-helix? (3-D structure)

## Globin

- **Hb**: sigmoidal (26 torr).
- Mb: hyperbolic (2.8 torr).
- Mb has a greater affinity than Hb for oxygen at all oxygen pressures.
- In the lungs, **Hb** is saturated
- In tissues, oxygen is released from **Hb** and transferred to Mb .

### The Bohr (pH) Effect

> Hemoglobin’s oxygen affinity decreases with decreasing pH and increasing CO2, causing the release of oxygen in tissues

PS: Bohr Effect is based on pH effect; pH Changes the conformation of the Myoglobin and Hemoglobin. (R state (oxy-form) to T state (deoxy-form))

*[Protonatable]: 可质子化

- Protonatable His~146~ of the &beta; subunit is the key of Bohr effect.
> - In the tissues (a low pH), His~146~ forms a salt-bridge with Asp~94~ and its backbone with Lys~40~ of the, stabilizing the T state in tissues (Deoxy-form).
> - In the lungs (a high pH), the salt-bridge is disrupted, promoting the T to R transition (Oxy-form).

|:-:|
|[&copy; Molview; PDBID=1B86; BPG and Hemoglobin](https://molview.org/?pdbid=1B86)|

> - 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) binds to hemoglobin (T state) and decreases oxygen affinity.
> - BPG is produced within erythrocytes
> - BPG is involved in high altitude adaptation
> - BPG binds at the interface of &beta;~1~ and &beta;~2~ chains stabilized by numerous ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions
> - Fetal hemoglobin (&gamma;) doesn't bind BPG
>   - b/c His143 -> Ser mutation at the BPG binding site

## Structure and Function of Antibody

> - Antibodies function by interacting with foreign (antigen) molecules
> - The antigen binding sites are produced by the variable domains from ==heavy and light== chains.
> - Several "hypervariable" loops are at the end of the variable domain.
> - The two light chains and the two heavy chains are identical: the two antigen-binding sites are identical.

> - Antibodies have H~2~L~2~ stoichiometry
>     - H is a “heavy” chain and L is a “light” chain
> - Each chain has one variable domain
> - All domains (4 in each heavy chain and 2 in each light chains) have the same "immunoglobulin fold"
>   - &alpha; &beta;-sandwich with &alpha; 4-stranded and &alpha; 3-stranded sheet connected by a disulfide bond.

### Antibody Peptide Interactions

> - Strong and highly specific binding requires numerous favorable interactions between antibody and antigen.
>   - Involving ==hydrophobic==, ==ionic== and ==hydrogen== bonding interactions.

**Structural states of myosin during the contractile cycle.**
1. Without bound nucleotide, myosin is strongly bound to actin (rigor state).
2. ATP binding to myosin dissociates the actin-myosin complex.
3. ATP is then hydrolyzed in ADP+Pi. There is a swing of the lever arm (green arrow).
4. Myosin can rebind to actin
5. Release its hydrolysis products and produce its force (green arrow) and again strongly bound to actin without nucleotide bound (power stroke, red arrow)
