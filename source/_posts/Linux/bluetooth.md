## Linux Blue tooth Trouble Shoot

Reference: [system 76](https://support.system76.com/articles/bluetooth/)

Except Nvidia driver, bluetooth driver could be an annoying one, too. Link above list lost of possible ways to deal with the bluetooth.

Im my situation, I am using `Pop 20.04 focal` which kernel is `x86_64 Linux 5.16.19-76051619-generic`. Very interesting thing is I can connect my Cellphone with bluetooth but not head buds. After tried a few codes from the blog of  [system 76](https://support.system76.com/articles/bluetooth/), my problem was solved by reset the bluetooth devices profile.

```bash
sudo rm -r /var/lib/bluetooth/
```
