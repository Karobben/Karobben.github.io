## Mount the disk

if the name of your drive you want to mount is `/dev/sda2`. And you want to mount it as `/media/Side`, the quickest way is:

```bash
sudo mkdir /media/Side
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/Side
```

## Check the drive list and find it

`df -h` could view all hard drive storage information
`fdisk -l`  could print more detailed partition drives

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

As you can see the basic information belowe. This Disk as 3.7 TiB in total but was splited into four partitions

<pre>
Disk /dev/sda: 3.7 TiB, 4000787030016 bytes, 7814037168 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 01EA470B-E7C7-4AB8-BCE5-88319B2E0C64

Device          Start        End    Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sda1        2048     264191     262144  128M Microsoft reserved
/dev/sda2      264192 3894284119 3894019928  1.8T Microsoft basic data
/dev/sda3  3894284288 3895334911    1050624  513M EFI System
/dev/sda4  3895334912 7814035455 3918700544  1.8T Linux filesystem
</pre>


we can also use `sudo parted -l` to print partitions, only ([phoenixnap, 2020](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-create-partition)):
<pre>
Model: ATA ST4000DM004-2CV1 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 4001GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                          Flags
 1      1049kB  135MB   134MB                Microsoft reserved partition  msftres
 2      135MB   1994GB  1994GB  ntfs         Basic data partition          msftdata
 3      1994GB  1994GB  538MB   fat32        EFI System Partition          boot, esp
 4      1994GB  4001GB  2006GB  ext4
</pre>

And you can see that half of it, 1.8 TiB was given Linux system and another half was given Windows System.




## Windows ntf disk in Linux


<pre>
mkdir: cannot create directory 'ken': Read-only file system
</pre>


```bash
sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda2
```

<pre>
Mounting volume... OK
Processing of $MFT and $MFTMirr completed successfully.
Checking the alternate boot sector... OK
NTFS volume version is 3.1.
NTFS partition /dev/sda2 was processed successfully.
</pre>

You may need to reboot and re-mount to work
