## Using Vim as IDE

Vim is a classic text editor known for efficiency, while NeoVim is its modernized fork with improvements like better plugin support. LunarVim, built on NeoVim, offers a pre-configured setup, making it easier for users to get a powerful, feature-rich environment without the hassle of individual configurations. Ideal for those new to Vim/NeoVim or seeking a ready-to-use development setup, LunarVim combines ease of setup with customizability. It's particularly appealing for its integrated toolset, active community support, and a balance between functionality and performance, making it a great choice for a streamlined coding experience.

## Installation

Please install the latest NeoVim by following the [Neovim document](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and [LunarVim Document](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation)

```bash
# install neovim
# sudo apt install neovim
# install vim-plug
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

# for storing the config file
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
touch ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
# for storing plug
# because all plug would be installed by here, you could just delete the directories here to delete plugs.
mkdir ~/.vim/plugged
# open and edit the config file
vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

Save the lines below in the `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` file to install the pluges.

<pre>
" Specify a directory for plugins
" - Avoid using standard Vim directory names like 'plugin'
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" List of plugins.
" Make sure you use single quotes

" Shorthand notation
Plug 'jalvesaq/Nvim-R', { 'branch' : 'stable' }
Plug 'ncm2/ncm2'
Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp'
Plug 'gaalcaras/ncm-R'
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
Plug 'Raimondi/delimitMate'
Plug 'patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty'
Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'

" Initialize plugin system
call plug#end()
</pre>


!!! note How to instsall the plunges
    After stored the change, you need to open it again by using `nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. And then, under the command model (which is triggered by `:`), input `PlugInstall` (`PlugUpdate` if you want to update them). After you see the picture below which means you installed it successfully:![](https://imgur.com/SMB1YM3.png)

By following the instruction from [rohitfarmer](https://gist.github.com/rohitfarmer/68cdadeaeeb196e8a6ecdebdee6e76a5)'s post, we could add more things at the end of the `init.vim` file:

,nt               " Open a new tab
,tn               " Move to the next tab
,tp               " Back to the previous tab

# code fold behavior

za - Toggle between closing and opening the fold under the cursor.
zR - Open all folds in the current buffer.

# wrap the words in it is too long
:set wrap 
:set nowrap
# set the wrap behavior
:set showbreak=↪\ 
```

## Bugs

After installed the Nvim-R (them master branch), you'll have the error code below whenever you open nvim. Just ignore it and it would be fine.
<pre>
Error detected while processing function ROnJobStdout[40]..UpdateSynRhlist[11]..FunHiOtherBf:

## Configure for LuanrVim

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cat "$HOME/.cargo/env" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# install LunarVim
