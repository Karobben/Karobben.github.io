## Introduction

Fruit fly has a long history as the model organism. Thomas Hunt Morgan is one of the first scientists made major contribution on fruit fly experiments in 1900s and push this organisms on the stage of the genetics. Drosophila melanogaster (Dmel) which is one of most popular species among other fruit flies are widely used in genetic, longevity, development,  and behavior studies. The merits of Dmel is outstanding: low cost, rapid generation, lots of offspring, well defined phenotype corresponded genotype, short life span, and elegant genome and simplified but highly homology pathways. Those all advantages made Dmel be a ideal and in irreplacable experiment organism and also contributed lots of early Nobel Prize by Thomas Hunt Morgan[^Morgan_16] and Hermann Muller[^Muller_28].

Low maintains and elegant genome size could be found on other model organism like C. elegans. But Dmel share about 60% of homologous gene to human and 75% of them are responsible to human disease[^Ugur_B_16] which makes them be a popular model to study disease like Alzmass, Non-specific immunity, muscle development diseases, and even cancer. Especially for Dmel tumor, the number of studies are rise exponentially after 90s[^Mirzoyan_19].

Cancer hall marks: sustaining proliferative signaling, Evading grouwth suppressors, activating invasion and metastasis, enabliing replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and resisting cell death are well described majority of cancer types among human[^Hanahan_11]. Those hall mars could also be found on fly tumor models. *Srcib* mutate clone of Dmel laval developed tumor on the Wing-Disk and because of the sustaining proliferation, it could growth larger them its normal size and leading the laval death[^Ji_19_Disease]. *Scrib* along may cause some cell autophage, but with more over activate *Ras*, tumor could evade death and went to over proliferation[^Uhlirova_06]. Salivary gland tumor which induced by Notch also show the invasive property[^Jhappan_1992][^Yang_19]. Tumor in drosophila can not lost long because it would cause cachexia-like wasting and cause early death[^Figueroa_15]. By transplanting the tumor tissue in to the abdomen of the drosophila and passing them each week could shows that it could became eternal cells[^Jiang_18_NC]. Those funding conformed the similarity between human tumor and drosophila tumor and established the drosophila research on tumor initiation, devaluing, and finally cause cachexia and host death. 

Drosophila wing disc is a powerful tool to studied the well controlled differentiation and tumor initiation. With the elegant regulation of signal pathway like Hippo and Wnt, it can increase its size by thousand-fold in 5 days[^LeGoff_13]. Expression of dlg-IR could induce apoptosis and in an invasion-like pheno-type in wing disk. In in egr-/- clone, the cell death of wing disk is totally blocked[^Cordero_10]. Another well established research find that the lgl4 mutants could cause tumor initiation in the wing disk-tumor[^Agrawal_95]. Sun, et al., verified that Yki mutation could also lead wing disk tumor[^sun_2011]. scrib [^Ji_19_Disease] and wts[^Pascual_17] mutation could also lead the wing disk tumor. 

Eye disk was first introduced in 1976[^Ready_76].

## Martial and Method

### RNA-Seq General Processing

At the end of the year 2022, we found approximately 30 projects and downloaded a total of 32 tumor models, which included multiple tumor types in some projects, as well as 215 biological groups and 517 sample from NCBI. We download all data from NCBI by using sra-tools and removed DNA-Seq, CHIP-Seq, and single cell RNA-Seq data and cooperate with our unpublished RNA-Seq data to run the standard processing. We use fastp 0.22.0[^fastp] to do run the raw reads quality control. Adaptors and low quality bases from the ends of the reads or low quality read are auto trimmed by fastp with default parameters. Quality before and after auto-trim is estimated by samtools. After quality control, we align the reads into the genome dme6 with bowtie2[^botwie2] by following the instruction of Trinity-RNA seq[^trinity]. After alignment, we also use RSEM 1.2.31[^rsem] to count the reads and edger 3.36.0[^edgeR] for following differential expression genes (DES) calculation. We use threshold of P ≤ 0.001 and a log2 fold change of 2 for filtering the significant DEG. The following Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is using clusterProfiler 4.2[^clusterprofiler]. All results are kept.
