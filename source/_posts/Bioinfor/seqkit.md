## Install

GitHub: [shenwei356/seqkit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit)

```bash
wget https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit/releases/download/v2.7.0/seqkit_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf seqkit_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

### Convert the Fastq to Fasta

```bash
seqkit fq2fa output_directory/output_prefix.extendedFrags.fastq -o output_directory/output_prefix.merged.fasta
```

### Remove Duplicated Sequence

```bash
seqkit rmdup -s sequences.fasta -o unique_sequences.fasta -D counts.tsv
```

*   `-s`: Specifies that duplicates should be identified based on sequence content.
*   `[input_file]`: Replace this with the path to your input FASTA or FASTQ file.
*   `-o [output_file]`: Specifies the output file. Replace `[output_file]` with the desired path for the file containing the sequences after duplicate removal.
*   `-D`: write all removed duplicates (and counts) to this specified file.
