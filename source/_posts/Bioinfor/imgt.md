## What is IMGT/V-QUEST database?

IMGT/V-QUEST is a specialized database and analysis tool that is part of the broader IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®. This system is a high-quality integrated knowledge resource specializing in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TCR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of all vertebrate species, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of any species.

IMGT/V-QUEST specifically provides detailed analysis of nucleotide sequences for immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TCR). It is widely used in immunology and related research fields for tasks such as:

1. **Sequence Analysis:** It allows for the identification and delimitation of V, D, and J genes and alleles in the input sequences. This is crucial for understanding the genetic basis of the immune response.

2. **Clonotype Characterization:** Researchers use it to characterize the clonotypes (unique T cell or B cell receptor sequences) in an individual's immune repertoire, which is important in studies of immune system diversity and response.

3. **Somatic Hypermutation Studies:** It helps in the analysis of somatic hypermutations, which are critical for understanding adaptive immunity and processes like affinity maturation.

4. **Comparative Immunology:** By providing a comprehensive and curated database of IG and TCR sequences across different species, it aids in comparative immunology studies.

As of my last update in April 2023, IMGT/V-QUEST continues to be a valuable resource for immunologists, molecular biologists, and other researchers studying the adaptive immune system. The database is regularly updated to include new findings and sequences, ensuring its relevance and usefulness in the field.

## What is IMGT-Ontology?

IMGT/Ontology is a key component of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®. It represents the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and is a foundational aspect of the IMGT® information system. Developed by Marie-Paule Lefranc and her team, IMGT/Ontology provides a standardized vocabulary and a set of concepts that are essential for the consistent annotation, description, and comparison of the immune system's components across different species. So, **IMGT/Ontology is more of a set of criteria or a framework rather than a specific tool or software.**

Key features and aspects of IMGT/Ontology include:

<details><summary>1. Standardized Vocabulary</summary>IMGT/Ontology provides a controlled vocabulary for the description of immunogenetic sequences. This includes terms for genes, alleles, and other genetic elements relevant to immunogenetics.
</details>
<details><summary>
2. Classification Criteria</summary>It establishes clear and standardized criteria for the classification of immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TCR), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This classification is crucial for the accurate comparison and analysis of these molecules.
</details>
<details><summary>
3. Identification of Key Concepts</summary>The ontology identifies and defines key concepts in immunogenetics, such as gene segment functionality, recombination features, and junctional diversity. These concepts are critical for understanding the adaptive immune response.
</details>
<details><summary>
4. IMGT-ONTOLOGY Axioms</summary>These are the rules that define the relations between the concepts and are used for the annotation and description of the IG, TCR, and MHC sequences in the IMGT® databases and tools.
</details>
<details><summary>
5. Facilitating Data Integration and Analysis</summary>By providing a common framework and language, IMGT/Ontology enables the integration, analysis, and sharing of immunogenetic data across different research projects and databases.
</details>
<details><summary>
6. Support for Research and Clinical Applications</summary>The standardized approach of IMGT/Ontology supports various research and clinical applications, including antibody engineering, vaccine development, and the study of immune responses.

!!! note IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts

> Seven IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms have been defined: 'IDENTIFICATION' [^18], 'DESCRIPTION' [^19], 'CLASSIFICATION' [^20], 'NUMEROTATION' [^21][^22], 'LOCALIZATION', 'ORIENTATION', and 'OBTENTION'. They constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY or IMGT-Kaleidoscope [^15].

IMGT/Ontology is a critical resource for researchers and professionals in immunology, genetics, bioinformatics, and related fields. It ensures that data and analyses are consistent, reproducible, and interoperable, which is vital in advancing our understanding of the immune system and in developing immunotherapy and other medical applications.
