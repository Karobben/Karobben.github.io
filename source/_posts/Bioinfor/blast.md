excerpt: "The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families."

## Blast+


[latest release](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)


## Installation
For Ubuntu or Debian (Deepin, like me)
```bash
sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+
```

For other distributions:
```bash
wget -c https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.12.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz
tar -zxvf ncbi-blast-2.12.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz
cd ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin
```

## Quick Start

### make blast base
```bash
makeblastdb -in db.fasta -dbtype prot/nucl -parse_seqids -out dbname
```

### model of uniprot annotation
```bash
blastx -query T0.05.fa -out blast.out -db /media/ken/Base/blastdb/uniprot_sprot.fasta -outfmt "6 qacc sacc evalue stitle sblastname" -evalue 1e-5 -max_target_seqs 1 -num_threads 8 -max_hsps 1
```

## Output format
```bash
