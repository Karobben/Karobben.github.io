## Install
```bash
sudo pip3.7  install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple fpdf
```

## Quick Start

```python
from fpdf import FPDF

pdf = FPDF()   # save FPDF() class into a variable pdf
pdf.add_page() # Add a page

pdf.set_font("Arial", size = 15) # set style and size of font that you want in the pdf

pdf.cell(200, 10, txt = "GeeksforGeeks",  
         ln = 1, align = 'C') # create a cell
pdf.cell(200, 10, txt = "A Computer Science portal for geeks.",
         ln = 2, align = 'C') # add another cell

pdf.output("GFG.pdf")         # save the pdf with name .pdf
```
**Output**:
![GFG.pdf](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200108153749/GFG201.jpg)

It works, but you need to slicing the sentences before running this codes or the contents will **run out of the page**.

By solving this problem, there is a script in github: [baruchel
](https://github.com/baruchel/txt2pdf). It's not perfect but it works.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baruchel/txt2pdf.git
txt2pdf -s 12 -o document.pdf document.txt
```
