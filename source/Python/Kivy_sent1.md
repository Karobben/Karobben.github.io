# Learn Kivy from Sent: Lesson 1

Introduction of kivy:

Installation: Skip

python: <span style="background:salmon">python=3.7.5 is strongly recommended!!</span>

So, if you want to write an app for windows, linux, IOS, and Android with only one set of code, then, Kivy is the best choice for you.

# Hello World

first, you'd like to `import kivy` and `from kivy.app import App`;
Then, you'd like `from kivy.uix.label import Label` so **you can add some text**
Add `kivy.require("1.10.1")` to assign the version of the kivy. (PS: actually, mine is 1.11.1)

Then, we can start to class a `class EpicApp(App)`

```python3
import kivy
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label # so you can add some text

kviy.require("1.10.1") # Assign the version of the kivy so every body would be on the same page


class EpicApp(App):
    ''' After class, we'd like to initializing the App'''
    def build(self):
      return Label(text="Hello world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  EpicApp().run()
```
So, it'll be your first kivy app!

It is not interesting at all, actually. So, Let's move one for `GridLayout`

# GridLayout

Now, let's add `from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout` to import the Layout style for organizing sort of things;
`from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput` to add a `TextInput` box.

Now, Our class are becoming more complicated
So, during the initiation in `build` section, we not `return` to a simple text `Label` anymore. Let's say, to `return` to a class named `ConnectPage`.

And let's sorting stuff in `ConnectPage` by `GridLayout`

```python3
import kivy
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label
from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout  # one of many layout structures
from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput  # allow for ...text input.

kivy.require("1.10.1")

# An actual app is likely to consist of many different
# "pages" or "screens." Inherit from GridLayout
class ConnectPage(GridLayout):
    # runs on initialization
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # we want to run __init__ of both ConnectPage AAAAND GridLayout
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self.cols = 2  # used for our grid

        # widgets added in order, so mind the order.
        self.add_widget(Label(text='IP:'))  # widget #1, top left
        self.ip = TextInput(multiline=False)  # defining self.ip...
        self.add_widget(self.ip) # widget #2, top right

        self.add_widget(Label(text='Port:'))
        self.port = TextInput(multiline=False)
        self.add_widget(self.port)

        self.add_widget(Label(text='Username:'))
        self.username = TextInput(multiline=False)
        self.add_widget(self.username)


class EpicApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return ConnectPage()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    EpicApp().run()
```

And that is what will we get! Awesome, hum?
