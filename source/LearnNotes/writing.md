# TOEFL Independent Writing

##  Solving Problem Along or Together

Copy from: [新东方在线](https://toefl.koolearn.com/20180503/824499.html)
Proofreader: Karobben

Which one do you prefer, to solve problems on your own experience and knowledge, or to ask others for advice?

As knowledge and experience serve as two towers in problem-solving, one is often presented with two major paths that pave the way for final fulfillment, either to wrack his brain, just like what happened to Neuton, sitting for many years under an apple tree and eventually figuring out one of the greatest universal rules that govern the whole globe, or to seek for other's wisdom through their advice, just as in the case of Benjamin Franklin, gathering great minds under one roof and then establishing a most world-renown library. Both ways work. When a practical goal is involved, however, Benjamin Franklin may best be regarded as a role model in this respect, and asking people for advice often turns out to be the primer alternative.

Experience and knowledge borrowed or learned from others' advice contribute greatly to the effectiveness and efficiency of a goal-accomplishment. Not all experience and knowledge related to problem-solving can be obtained by personal effort alone due to the limitation of the mind and capabilities of each individual. A single thought in someone's mind is, more often than not, far less shining compared with the group's wisdom. That explains the famous old saying that one sees further when standing on the shoulders of past great giants; that explains why a great leader is always with greater minds; that also explains why teamwork in cooperation is highly emphasized in the 21st century. Brainstorm and exchange of ideas between different thoughts never fail to enhance the capabilities of each individual involved, a team, a company, an institution, a country, or even the entire global village.

Asking other's advice instead of getting everything done on one's own promotes democracy and communication too. In terms of democracy, it is necessary to give others rights and chance to speak since the problem may concern them in different ways, and their saying in turn reflects our respect toward freedom of speech as well as their wisdom. In terms of communication, idea exchange sometimes focuses more than solutions, and hereby better mutual understanding about perspectives, principles, practicalities, and personalities of each other.

Admittedly turning to others for help and suggestion by no means refers to absolute and irresponsible dependence. Consideration upon different thoughts and ideas broadens our mind, enlarges our vision, furthers understanding, enhances more effective and efficient brainstorm, and stresses mutual respect in groups and communities, which undoubtedly gives rise to better, if not the best solutions. As is paraphrased from John F Kennedy, brainstormed, there is litter we cannot do while divided, there is little we can do.

After they complete their university studies, some students live in their hometowns. Others live in different towns and cities. Which do you think is beterr? Give reasons for your answer.

After they complete their university studies, some students prefer to live in their hometowns while others choose to live in different towns or cities. Everybody has his own hometowns or cities. Everybody has his own reason for his preference. After graduation, I will go back and live in my home city. I have made this decision because of the following reasons.

Firstly, my home city is a big city that can offer a lot. There are plenty of opportunities for work, many big libraries for studies, several different museums for visit, and numerous cinemas, theaters, and centers for entertainment. When I go back there, I'll have no difficulty in finding a job suitable for me and I can make use of all the facilities available there.

Secondly, if I go back to my home city, I can look after my parents. I take this into consideration because I am their only child and they are now weak and getting on in age. If I live in the same city as them, I can visit them very often and help them whenever it is necessary.

Thirdly, if I live in my home city, I will have a lot of friends, schoolmates, and relatives to visit and to turn to for help when I need it. Of course, I could get acquainted with many people and make many friends if I went to live in a strange place, but that takes time. If I go back to my home city, everybody will wait for me and I will be able to settle down comfortably without any trouble and waste of time.

In short, my choice is based on careful consideration of my home city and my family. I think it's a better and a sensible choice; in a certain sense, it is a must.

## Good Neighbor

 Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbor? Use specific details and examples in your answer.

If you have a good neighbor, you are a lucky person. You have someone who cares about your needs and property, who is helpful in the little day-to-day situation that comes up, and who is supportive in times of crisis.

A good neighbor is someone who, for instance, understands that your children may occasionally run across his lawn, even though you tell them not to. He'll realize that children can be careless about things like that, and he won't make a big fuss about it unless it becomes a regular thing. In the same vein, he knows that you'll understand if some of the trash from his trash cans blows across into your yard. In other words, he is sensitive to the unintentional things that can happen. He doesn't make a big deal about them.

A good neighbor is also respectful of your property. For example, she asks your permission before doing anything that interferes with what's yours. This means she wouldn't plant a huge tree in between your house without asking how you felt about it. If she wanted to put up a fence, she would let you know first. She might work with you to decide where it should be placed. Maybe the two of you would even split the cost.

A good neighbor would lend you some milk if you ran out. She'd give you a ride to work if your car was broken, and let your children stay at her house in the evening if you got stuck working overtime. You would do the same for her. Both of you would help make the other's life easier.

When something really awful happens to you, like a death in the family, a good neighbor will volunteer to help in any way he can. This could mean something small, like making some casseroles to put in your freezer to feed visiting relatives. Or it could mean something big, like helping you get through the sadness of the funeral. I think only someone who has experienced a bad neighbor can really appreciate a good one! A good neighbor can be a good friend. He or she can make all the difference in the world to your life.

## Eating Outside or at home

Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and esamples to support your answer.

Some people like to eat out at food stands and restaurants, while others like to prepare food at home. Often, it depends on the kind of lifestyle people have. Those with very busy jobs outside the house don't always have time to cook. They like the convenience of eating out. Overall, though, it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home.

While eating in restaurants is fast, the money you spend can add up. When I have diner at a restaurant with friends, the bill is usually over twenty dollars. I can buy a lot of groceries with that much money. Even lunch at a fast-food stand usually costs five or six dollars for one person. THat's enough to feed the whole family at home. If you cook food at home, you have more control over the ingredients. You can use margarine instead of butter on your potatoes, or not put so much cheese on top of your pizza. At home, you can control your portion size. You can serve yourself as little as you want. In a restaurant, you may eat a full plate of food "because you paid for it".

It's true that eating out is convenient. You don't have to stop, or cook, or clean up. But real home cooking doesn't have to take up a lot of time. There are lots of simple meals that don't take long to make. In fact, they're faster than eating out, especially if you think of the time you spend driving to a restaurant, parking, waiting for a table, waiting for service, and driving home.

Both eating at restaurants and cooking at home can be satisfying. Both can taste good and be enjoyed with family and friends. I prefer cooking at home because of money and health issues. but people will make the choice that fits their lifestyle best.

Personally,
I prefer cooking at home for several reasons.

Most people believe that eating at stands or restaurants is a kind of time-saving since we need to pro-process the foodstuffs, flavor and cook them, and clean everything up if we eat at home. It seems time-consuming than eating out. But that's not quite true. There are more choices compared with eating outside and a quick meal is such an answer. For example, we can boil some noodles, vegetables, and eggs and flavoring them with sauces. It just takes 3 min to boil water, and 5 min to finish the cook. On the other hand, if you not satisfied with this, you can prepare more then one meal for each time just as I always did. So, for the next meal, it just takes 2 mins to heat it by microwave-oven. Compared to eating outside, I need to take time to pick a restaurant, make a very hard order since there are so many choices on the menu, wait for the service, and finally, eat it. If we hit a traffic jam or a long waiting list, it takes more.
