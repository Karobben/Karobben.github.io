# Stocking Density Effects on Fish

# Introduction

- growth and performance of some salmonids [^Schreck] [^Vijayan][^In6]
- decreased food consumption[^Refstie]
- social interaction[^Fenderson][^Refstie]
- altered water quality[^Pickering-1][^Pickering-2]
- growth-regulating role of hormones in fish held at high stocking density [^Leatherland][^Vijayan]
- chronic stress; water quality, <span style="background:salmon">adverse social interactions</span> or over-crowding, negative physiological and biochemical changes [^In6][^In7]
- Reducing Lysozyme[^In8][^In9]

These results **suggest** that high stocking density has the effect of mobilizing triglyceride sources, promoting gluconeogenesis from glycerol, but has little effect on protein metabolism.

- 18 weeks

- diets supplemented with 450 mg of vitamin E showed an increase (P!0.05) in the accumulation of macrophages  foreign body giant cells and Langhans type cells.

- **not show a similar difference** in plasma cortisol concentrations related to **stocking density**

[^Rowland]: Rowland, Stuart J., et al. "Effects of stocking density on the performance of the Australian freshwater silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) in cages." Aquaculture 253.1-4 (2006): 301-308.

- Densities of 12, 25, 50, 100 or 200 fish/m^3^ in cages (1 m3) in an aerated
- Cultured for 210 days

- There was **aggression** between fish in cages stocked at 25 or 50 fish/m^3^
- survival (50% and 64.5%, respectively) was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than at the other densities (87.5%, 98.5% and 97.4%).
- Stocking density did not affect final weight (454.6–471.1 g), specific growth rate (0.65–0.70%/day) or absolute growth rate (1.6–1.7 g/fish/day)
- feed conversion ratios (FCR) of fish stocked at 25 or 50 fish/m^3^ (4.4 and 3.7) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than FCRs (range, 2.3–2.5) at other densities.
- Coefficients of **variation in weight** (CV) at 25 or 50 fish/m^3^ (24.4% and 28.3%) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than at other densities and the lowest CV of 16.1% was at 200 fish/m^3^.
- Production was significantly affected (P < 0.01) by stocking density, with the highest mean rate of 88.5 kg/m^3^ in cages stocked with 200 fish/m^3^.
- One infestation of the ectoparasitic ciliate, Chilodonella hexasticha, and two infestations of the monogenean gill fluke, Lepidotrema bidyana, were each treated successfully with an application of 30 mg/l formalin. The high survival, relatively fast growth, low variation in weight and high production rates of silver perch stocked at 100 or 200 fish/m^3^ demonstrate that cages are a viable alternative to ponds for the commercial production of silver perch.

Survival, final weight, coefficient of variation of weight (CV), specific growth rate (SGR), absolute growth rate (AGR), production and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of silver perch (initial mean weights, 109.3-115.4g) cultured for 210 days at five stocking densities in cages

**Feeding Behavior**
- Fish in cages stocked at 100 or 200 fish/m^3^ always fed strongly at and near the **surface**,
- Feeding behavior in cages stocked at 25 or 50 fish/m^3^ was **intermediate**, with fish mostly feeding mid-water, but at **times feeding** strongly **near the surface**.
- fish stocked at 12 fish/m^3^ usually fed **mid-water** and were rarely seen feeding near the surface throughout the experiment

**Aggression Behavior**
- observed daily in at 25 or 50 fish/m^3^,
- eroded fins
- **no obvious signs** of aggression in cages stocked at 12, 100 or 200 fish/m^3^
