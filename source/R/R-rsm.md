# Introduction of RSM and rsm pacakge

Response-surface methodology comprises a body of methods for exploring for **optimum operating conditions** through experimental methods.

The rsm package for R (R Development Core Team 2009[^1]) provides several functions to facilitate classical response-surface methods.

Commercial Software for rsm:
- Design-Expert
- JMP
- Statgraphics

***rsm*** <span style="color:salmon">covers only</span> the most standard **first-and second order designs** and methods for **one response variable**.

**desirability** package (Kuhn 2009) may be used in conjunction with predictions obtained using the **rsm** package

The first block, ChemReact1, uses factor settings of `Time = 85 ± 5` and `Temp = 175 ± 5`, with three center points. Thus, the coded variables are `x1 = (Time − 85)=5` and `x1 = (Temp − 175)=5`.

```r
CR1 <- coded.data(ChemReact1, x1 ~ (Time - 85)/5, x2 ~ (Temp - 175)/5)
CR1
```
```
Time Temp Yield

5   85  175  83.9
6   85  175  84.3

Data are stored in coded form using these coding formulas ...

# CCD (Central-Composite Design)
One of the most popular response-surface designs is the central-composite design (CCD), due to Box and Wilson (1951)[^2].

  #First, install and load the "rsm" package

  # install.packages("rsm")
  library(rsm)

  # Example generating a Box-Behnken design with three factors and two center points (no)
  bbd(3, n0 = 2, coding = list(x1 ~ (Force - 20)/3, x2 ~ (Rate - 50)/10, x3 ~ Polish - 4))


  # Example data set
  data = ChemReact
  plot(data)


  # The data set was collected in two blocks.
  # Block1 is a 2-level, two-factor factorial design with three repeated center points.
  # Block 2 is the Central Composite Design (circomscribed) with 3 center points.
  # The variables are Time = 85 +/- 5 and Temp = 175 +/- 5,
  # Thus, the coded variables are  x1 = (Time-85)/5 and x2 = (Temp-175)/5
  CR <- coded.data(ChemReact, x1 ~ (Time - 85)/5, x2 ~ (Temp - 175)/5)
  CR[1:7,]

  # Note: If the data are already coded, use as.coded.data() to convert to the proper coded data object

  # Let's work as though the first block (full factorial) has been finished,
  # and we'll fit a linear model, first order (FO), to it (Yield is the response)
  CR.rsm1 <- rsm(Yield ~ FO(x1, x2), data = CR, subset = (Block == "B1"))
  summary(CR.rsm1)

  #The fit is not very good.  Let's include the interaction term (TWI) and update the model, or start over with a new model (these two lines do the same thing)
  CR.rsm1.5 <- update(CR.rsm1, . ~ . + TWI(x1, x2))
  CR.rsm1.5 <- rsm(Yield ~ FO(x1, x2)+TWI(x1, x2), data = CR, subset = (Block == "B1"))
  summary(CR.rsm1.5)
  #This is no better!  The reason is the strong quadratic response, with the peak near the center.

  # Now let's assume the second block has been collected.  We use the SO (second order) function, which includes FO and TWI
  CR.rsm2 <- rsm(Yield ~ Block + SO(x1, x2), data = CR)
  summary(CR.rsm2)

  # The secondary point is a maximum (both eigenvalues are negative) and within the experimental design range (no extrapolation)

  # Also note that the block is significant, meaning that the processes shifted between the first set of data and the second.  This is not good.  The coefficient is -4.5, meaning the yield shifted down by 4.5% between the two blocks - a more significant effect than either temperatue or time!  This is most easily seen by looking at the repeat center points.

  # We can plot the fitted response as a contour plot.
  contour(CR.rsm2, ~ x1 + x2, at = summary(CR.rsm2)$canonical$xs)
  ```

# On the other hand:
An other algorithm to plot the surface by `lm` which explained by Resseel V. Lenth 2010[^3]

```r
A.lm <- lm( Yield ~ poly(Time, Temp, degree =2),data=ChemReact1)
image(A.lm, Time~ Temp)
contour(A.lm, Time~ Temp)
persp(A.lm, Time~ Temp, col='blue', contours = list(z='top',col='orange'))

It's clearly different from the result above.
