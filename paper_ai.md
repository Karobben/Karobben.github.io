## Introduction

The fruit fly has a long history as a model organism, with Thomas Hunt Morgan being one of the first scientists to make major contributions to fruit fly experiments in the 1900s and pushing this organism onto the stage of genetics. Drosophila melanogaster (Dmel), which is one of the most popular species among other fruit flies, is widely used in genetic, longevity, development, and behavior studies. The merits of Dmel are outstanding, including low cost, rapid generation, lots of offspring, well-defined phenotype corresponding genotype, short life span, and elegant genome and simplified but highly homologous pathways. All of these advantages have made Dmel an ideal and irreplaceable experimental organism and have also contributed to many early Nobel Prizes, including those by Thomas Hunt Morgan[^Morgan_16] and Hermann Muller[^Muller_28].

Other model organisms such as C. elegans have also been noted for their simple genome size. However, Dmel stands out as a model organism due to its 60% homologous gene sharing with humans, with 75% of these genes being responsible for human diseases[^Ugur_B_16]. This feature makes Dmel a popular model organism for studying diseases such as Alzheimer's, non-specific immunity, muscle development diseases, and cancer. In particular, research on Dmel tumors has seen an exponential increase since the 1990s[^Mirzoyan_19].


The majority of human cancers exhibit well-described hallmarks including sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, activating invasion and metastasis, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and resisting cell death, as previously described by Hanahan and Weinberg[^Hanahan_11]. These hallmarks have also been observed in fly tumor models. Mutated clones of the Scribble gene in Drosophila larvae have developed tumors on the wing disk, leading to sustained proliferation and abnormal growth, ultimately resulting in larval death[^Ji_19_Disease]. Autophagy is observed in these tumors, but when the Ras pathway is overactivated, the tumor can evade death and continue to proliferate[^Uhlirova_06]. Salivary gland tumors induced by Notch in Drosophila also display invasive properties[^Jhappan_1992][^Yang_19]. However, Drosophila tumors cannot persist for long periods as it leads to cachexia-like wasting and early death[^Figueroa_15]. Transplanting tumor tissue into the abdomen of Drosophila and passing it on to subsequent generations demonstrates that the tumor can establish itself as an immortal cell line[^Jiang_18_NC]. These findings confirm the similarities between human and Drosophila tumors and establish Drosophila as a useful model organism for studying tumor initiation, progression, and the ultimate outcome of cachexia and host death.

The Drosophila wing disc is a valuable tool for investigating well-regulated differentiation and tumor initiation. Through elegantly regulated signaling pathways such as Hippo and Wnt, the wing disc can increase its size by a thousand-fold in just five days. The expression of dlg-IR can induce apoptosis and an invasion-like phenotype in the wing disc. Meanwhile, in egr-/- clones, cell death in the wing disc is entirely blocked. Moreover, a well-established study demonstrated that lgl4 mutants can initiate tumors in the wing disc[^Agrawal_95]. Additionally, Sun et al. showed that Yki mutation can also lead to wing disc tumors[^sun_2011]. Finally, Wts mutation could also cause wing disc tumors[^Pascual_17].

The eye disk was initially introduced in 1976 as a model for developmental biology research[^Ready_76]. The Hedgehog (Hh) signal pathway plays a crucial role in eye development and differentiation[^Heberlein_95], and it can regulate important genes through the Notch signal pathway[^Fu_03_dev]. Delta (DL), a transmembrane ligand of the Notch receptor, has downstream effects regulated by the Hh signal pathway[^Parks_95]. The conserved subunit complex CCR4-NOT plays a role as a tumor suppressor by regulating gene expression[^Collart_12]. Overexpressing DL and knocking down CCR4-NOT together can result in the development of Drosophila eye tumors[^Vicente_18]. Polycomb group (PcG) protein PRC1 (ph) is another gene that regulates gene expression[^Grossniklaus_14]. It suppresses tumor growth in Drosophila by repressing the Notch signal pathway[^Martinez_09]. Knocking down ph can induce the development of eye disk tumors, which can survive and grow larger after transplantation into the abdomen[^Torres_18][^Loubiere_16][^Jiang_18_NC].

Ras is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and thereby regulates cell growth[^Nash_94]. Scrib is a gene that encodes a protein with an essential role in cell polarity[^Bilder_00] and growth[^Albertson_03]. It can directly target the Hippo signaling pathway and modulate cell growth[^shen_21]. While over expression of activated Ras alone is not sufficient to induce tumor in the wing disk, mutated Ras alone is adequate to initiate tumor in the Dmel eye disk[^Külshammer]. Knockdown of scrib alone could induce wing disk tumor[^Ji_19_Disease], but not eye disk tumor[^Atkins_16]. However, the simultaneous overexpression of activated Ras and knockdown of scrib can cause more aggressive tumors in both the eye and wing disks[^Atkins_16][^Külshammer][^Hodgson_16].


WNT signals are responsible for cell fate determination through the canonical pathway and control of cell movement and tissue polarity through the noncanonical pathway[^Logan_04]. The canonical pathway is activated by the Frizzled (FZD) family receptors and LRP5/LRP6 coreceptor which transduces signals to the β-catenin signaling cascade[^Bhanot_96]. In the absence of WNT signals, the scaffold protein APC forms a degradation complex with other proteins such as AXIN, CKIα (casein kinase Iα), and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) to promote β-catenin degradation[^Price_2006]. In the noncanonical pathway, Dishevelled, which is also required in the canonical pathway, activates the JNK signaling pathway[^Boutros_98][^Majidinia_17]. P53 is an essential oncogene that coordinates the DNA repair system and the cell cycle checkpoint[^Karimian_16], and it is crucial for cancer cell fate. On one hand, p53 mediates the degradation of β-catenin via E3 ubiquitin ligase[^Matsuzawa_01]. On the other hand, the canonical wnt signaling pathway upregulates the expression of the ARF tumor suppressor protein and directly activates p53 to trigger a p53 response[^Oren_02].

Scrib^-^ has been found to activate the Hippo Signaling pathway, leading to tumor initiation; however, the cell would simultaneously activate the JNK signaling pathway, inducing apoptosis[^Chen_12]. Numerous studies indicate that mutating Ras along with scrib^-^ can rescue cell apoptosis by activating the JNK signaling pathway[^Uhlirova_05][^Brumby_03]. Additionally, JNK is essential for hippo activation-induced cell invasion. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of bsk^DN^ could influence the activities of Hippo itself[^Ma_17].

## Martial and Method

### RNA-Seq General Processing

At the conclusion of the year 2022, we discovered roughly 30 projects and procured a total of 32 tumor models, which encompassed several tumor types within certain projects, as well as 215 biological groups and 517 samples from NCBI. We utilized sra-tools to obtain all data from NCBI and excluded DNA-Seq, CHIP-Seq, and single-cell RNA-Seq data. We then employed our unpublished RNA-Seq data to execute standard processing. For raw reads quality control, we utilized fastp 0.22.0[^fastp]. Adaptors, low-quality bases from the ends of reads, or low-quality reads were automatically trimmed by fastp with default parameters. Quality before and after auto-trimming was estimated by samtools. After quality control, we mapped the reads to the genome dme6 utilizing bowtie2[^bowtie2] following the guidelines of Trinity-RNAseq[^trinity]. Further more, we utilized RSEM 1.2.31[^rsem] to count the reads and edgeR 3.36.0[^edgeR] for differential expression gene (DES) calculation. We applied a threshold of P ≤ 0.001 and a log2 fold change of 2 for filtering significant DEG. The ensuing Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted utilizing clusterProfiler 4.2[^clusterprofiler].

### GESA clustering

After calculating the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) from both KEGG pathway gene sets and GO term gene sets (KGOS), we compiled all results together and transferred them into a sample-KGOS matrix. Any missing values were filled with 0 to ensure successful hirarchy cluster and Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA)[^WGCNA]. We opted to use WGCNA to cluster the KGOS as it not only clusters KGOS with similar changing patterns but also groups reversed KGOS into one module, an aspect that hierarchy may not be aware of the reversed patterns. Subsequently, we manually selected the module with DNA replication which had more than 400 KGOS in total. We then checked the p-value of the KGOS for each sample and filtered out the samples with insignificant adjusted p-values for most KGOS, and KGOS missing in most Samples. Following this filtration, we were left with 231 KGOS and 34 reliable samples. Next, we listed all genes from those KGOS for Network Analysis.

### Network Analysis

We retrieved physical connections from the STRING database[^string] and filtered out any connections with a total score below 150, keeping the remaining connections for further analysis. Protein IDs were converted to gene IDs using online tools from FlyBase. We selected genes that belonged only to the KGOS module as the main network and calculated the mean fold change value. Genes with an absolute value smaller than 1.5 and a degree less than 1 were filtered out to obtain key genes. We retained 1250 genes and 29174 connections, and utilized qgraph[^qgraph] to generate the Fruchterman Reingold layout[^layout] of each node (gene). Based on the log2FC distribution, we grouped the genes into two sets, with the mainly up-regulated set on the right and the down-regulated set on the left. We identified the boundary by using Gaussian smoothing from Python SciPy[^scipy] to smooth the log2FC value, with a value of 0 used to demarcate the boundary between the two groups. We identified potential hub genes from each group based on their degree rank, and cross-talking genes were manually determined based on their reversed group connection preference: the gene connected to a lesser number of genes from its own group than the other group.

## Result

### Similarities Among Samples

The majority of the samples possess sufficient quality to be utilized in our study. To present the quality before and after auto-trimming, we utilized a density plot. The scores before and after were found to be similar for over 90% of the samples (Fig. A). However, a high quality of raw reads does not necessarily ensure an appropriate library. We observed that certain libraries, such as Saliver gland G17F and G17M, exhibited a very high ratio of unmapped reads, indicating that most of the reads from these samples were incorrect. This could be due to erroneous operations during sequencing, as all other libraries from the same batch were deemed satisfactory (Fig. B). It may be reasonable for some gut samples to have approximately 50% of unmapped reads due to potential contamination from probiotics. We also noticed a relatively high mismatch rate in wing disc and eye disc samples. This could be caused by de novo mutations, but may also be attributed to complicated cross-background factors. 

After estimated the relative expression, we use hiearchy cluster to compaire all 543 samples. By exclussive the effects bring by tissue specific genes, we exclueded genes whcich TMM value is less then 10 even if only in one sample. By this critiria, we left 1185 genes and using them to plot heatmap (Fig. BB). Connected with the PCA results (Fig. BC), this result, we can find that the relateive expression are more corrolated in to Tiisues rather than the mutations. We also clustred samples based on the NES matrix and find that the clustring result are more tissue specific rather than driver specific (Fig. CC). And according to the PCA based on the KGOS, we can find that the difference among samples are mostly driven by tissues.

Summary the similarities and heterogenous between samples 

### DNA replication and autophayge correlated with each other

To establish the similarities in KGOS changing patterns among tumor samples, we utilized the WGCNA algorithm to cluster the NES matrix. Despite the availability of another clustering algorithm, CLEAN, designed for clustering NES matrix, it has a limitation of grouping only positively related clusters and lacks negative correlation awareness[^CLEAN]. With the parameters applied to run 4039 KGOS (Fig. I), we detected a certain number of modules, focusing on the module containing DNA replications (Fig. C). Further hierarchical clustering grouped the samples based on these modules into three categories: group 1 with mostly positive NES, group 2 with an almost reversed pattern from group 1, and group 3 with a more random distribution and most NES having a non-significant q value. Comparing groups 1 and 2 revealed a reversed pattern between the two sets, where the set with the most positive NES is related to DNA replication, repairing, and damage sensing, while the set with the most negative NES is related to metabolism, lysosome, and autophagy. It indicates a connection between DNA replication/damage and lysosome/autophagy, warranting further investigation into the genes.

To acquire more reliable data from reliable sources, we checked the relationship between q-value and NES. The majority of KGOS q-values from the samples are not significant, thus we filtered the data to avoid the negative effects of non-significant NES of KGOS and samples. We finally selected 231 KGOS and 34 samples based on the criteria mentioned in the method (Fig. D). Interestingly, all remaining samples belong to group 1, which can be explained by the fact that among the significant q-value group, positive NES are greater than negative NES (Fig. E). We listed the genes from all 231 KGOS and calculated the mean value of log2FC among the 34 samples, all belonging to group 1. We obtained 4155 genes in the list and further reduced redundant genes by deleting low expression changing genes with a fold change smaller than 1.5, resulting in a final list of 1250 genes.

### Hippo signaling pathway is activated in scrib know down samples

The gene Scrib plays a direct role in modulating the activity of Yki, thereby influencing cell growth by altering the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo pathway, in turn, can activate the translation of Wg and Dally, which are located at the head of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wg is a key ligand that can turn the canonical Wnt pathway on or off. Notably, NES scores are positive across all wing samples related to Scrib (Figure G). Among them, the Scrib tumor samples on day 6, 8, and 12 are particularly significant, indicating that the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway is also linked to the tissue's developmental stages over time.


### Wnt Signal pathway connected the DNA replication and autophayge reverse pattern 

The network data utilized in this study was sourced from the STRING database, specifically the physical interaction Drosophila data of version v11.5. We extracted the genes from the list and filtered those with a total score below 150. Prior to gene filtering, we observed 182,458 connections among 4155 genes. After filtering based on both logFC and degree number (less than 2), we obtained 29,174 connections and 1250 genes. Using qgraphic, we calculated the Fruchterman Reingold layout based on the smallest entropy of an electron-spring model system. This layout algorithm groups frequently connected genes and separates non-connected genes. The resulting distribution showed 3 to 4 groups based on the density of the special distribution and two groups based on the log2FC distribution. Most of the nodes on the left side were down-regulated while the right side was up-regulated (Fig. F). Based on the KGOS NES results, we propose that the genes on the down-regulated side are associated with lysosomes/autophagy, while the genes on the up-regulated side are linked to DNA damage. To validate this idea, we separated the genes into two groups, and the edge genes in the center with the largest changes were used for grouping. We employed Gaussian smoothing to smooth the logFC values and set the threshold as 0 to detect the edge of two groups (Fig. G). We identified hub genes from each group based on the number of degrees, and importantly, we identified cross-talking nodes (Fig. H). Among the cross-talking nodes, wg had the highest FC value. Furthermore, genes Dally, CanB2, and norpA were associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, while l(2)gl was involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is upstream of the Wnt pathway. These findings suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway may contribute to the observed pattern, which is high in DNA replication and damage repair and low in lysosome and autophagy activities.

### Wnt cross talk with and JNK

In order to reinforce the pivotal role of the Wnt signaling pathway, our attention was directed towards two primary organs, namely the eye disk and the wing disk, both of which are replete with Ras-scrib tumor model data. Within the wing disk model, we observed a greater predilection for the scrib tumor model to exhibit positive scores in relation to wnt, lysosom, and autophagy, while displaying significantly high scores in the latter and markedly low scores in relation to DNA repair and replication (Fig. G). These findings are consistent with the observed phenotype, which shows cell cycle arrest in the early stages, as well as autophagic activity in abnormal areas [^Ji_19_Disease]. However, when scrib and ras are mutated in unison, this pattern is reversed, as NES scores for DNA replication and repair are up-regulated, while those for wnt, lysosom, and autophagy are down-regulated. This implies that ras is capable of suppressing autophagy in the wing disk, thereby promoting its growth, as has been expounded upon in established research.

(Wnt: significantly down → significantly up) The Ras-scrib model in the eye disk shows a similar pattern to the Wing disk model, as previously mentioned. Interestingly, when bsk is mutated in the eye Ras-scrib model, the pattern is reversed, indicating that JNK plays a crucial role in this process. Additionally, disrupting some genes from the Jac/Stat pathway in the Ras-scrib model did not significantly alter the NES, although the tumor size was somewhat rescued. Overall, these findings suggest that scrib and ras collaborate to regulate the Hippo, Wnt, and JNK signaling pathways, thus maintaining the reverse pattern of DNA replication/repair and lysosome/autophagy activity.

JNK signaling pathway also plays a crucial role in this context. In a cohort of Eye disk Ras-scrib tumors, bsk dominant-negative clones were utilized to block the JNK signaling pathway and rescue the tumor phenotype. The resultant DNA replication/repair vs lysosome and autophagy pattern was also reversed. The GSEA analysis demonstrated that the Wnt signaling pathway was significantly upregulated after the knockdown of the JNK signaling pathway, while the DNA replication pathway was significantly downregulated (Fig. H and I). Furthermore, by comparing these results with those of the control group, it was found that cell death-related pathways such as apoptosis and mitophagy were significantly upregulated only in the Eye Ras-scrib bsk clone, and mismatch repair and Fanconi anemia pathways were significantly upregulated in Eye Ras-scrib only. These findings further confirmed the reversed pattern.

### Jun pathway activation and apoptosis activities

Scrib^-^ → JNK↑ (Marker) → Autophage↑ not Apoptophsis.
Scrib^-^ → Wnt family

The activation markers of the JNK signaling pathway, Mmp1 and puc, are significantly upregulated in the scrib^-^ wing disk, while the apoptosis marker Dcp-1 is downregulated, which is reversed to the autophagy marker Atg8. This observation may explain why the overexpression of p35 could not rescue the cell cycle arrest of the wing disk-scrib tumor in the early stage, as apoptosis is already suppressed and the degradation of cells in the scrib^-^ wing disk is mainly through autophagy, as suggested by the GSEA analysis (Fig. G).

Ras^-^ → metabolism↑ → Oxidative↑
Scrib^-^ + Ras^-^ → DNA Damage↑ 

In the Eye disk tumor model, it has been observed that the presence of the Ras mutation alone is sufficient to significantly upregulate various metabolic pathways, such as porphyrin metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, and retinol metabolism. The activation of these metabolic pathways may induce a considerable amount of metabolic waste, resulting in an imbalance of the oxidative environment. This could be the reason for the significant upregulation of oxidative activity as evidenced by the GSEA (Figure H). The excessive production of ROS from the increased oxidative activity can cause DNA damage, leading to cell death. However, in the presence of Scrib^-^, the hyperactivation of JNK suppresses autophagy and apoptosis. Simultaneously, the metabolism-related pathways associated with Ras^v12^ alone are no longer significant, and the oxidative signaling pathways are considerably downregulated. Under the influence of both Ras^v12^ and Scrib^-^, the Wnt signaling pathway and oxidative phosphorylation pathway are also suppressed.

JNK is the key for this all abnormals.

JNK is a well-known molecule that has been identified as both a tumor suppressor and a contributor to tumor initiation [^Tournier_13][^Kennedy_03_cc]. While some studies suggest that JNK is not essential for fibroblast tumor formation in mice [^Kennedy_03], in our case, it appears to play a critical role in tumor initiation. The Ras-scrib eye disk tumor is an extremely malignant tumor, and bsk^-^ has the potential to almost entirely rescue the tumor phenotype. As a result, we can conclude that, at least in the eye disk tumor model, JNK acts downstream of Ras, and its tumor-promoting role in Ras^-^ can be blocked by the JNK pathway.

In general, the induction of Ras^v12^ does not alter this phenomenon (Figure K). The Wnt signaling pathway is more intricate than the JNK pathway, as the Wnt family comprises many members. Among both early scrib and Ras-scrib tumors, Wnt2 is broadly downregulated. Conversely, some Wnt signals, such as Wnt4 and Wnt10, are upregulated in scrib tumors at 10 days, 12 days, and 14 days. However, all Wnt families are downregulated in the Eye Ras-scrib tumor (Figure J), and the NES is significantly negative (Figure H), indicating that the Wnt signaling pathway is significantly suppressed in the Eye Ras-scrib tumor, but not significantly suppressed in the Wnt disk Ras-scrib tumor.

## Discussion

1. scrib^-^ → hippo & Wnt

The Scrib tumor has the capability to activate the Hippo signaling pathway, which can result in the direct alteration of the expression levels of wg and dally in drosophila. Other experiments involving Scrib paralogs have confirmed its negative regulatory role in the Wnt signaling pathway[^Almeida_18]. Additionally, evidence suggests that the PDZ domains of Scrib can repress the Wnt signaling pathway by associating with β-catenin, which is modulated by Wnt3a[^Daulat_19]. In the scrib tumor model, we can find that most of samples significantly up regulate the Hippo signaling pahtways activities and partially upregulate Wnt. As a result, scrib nock down could up-regulate the Hippo and wnt signaling pathways. 

2. Ras → suppress the Wnt

In the Wnt pathway, the activated form of the Wnt receptor recruits the degradation complex in the presence of Wnt signaling, thereby releasing β-catenin. The β-catenin can then enter the nucleus and activate the translation of target genes. On the other hand, the degradation complex phosphorylates β-catenin and promotes its degradation. Once the position of the degradation complex is released, it can recruit other proteins, such as Ras, and promote the degradation of both Ras and β-catenin[^Jeong_18][^Lee_18]. As a result, Ras over activation could suprress the Wnt signaling pahtway which explained the Ras^V12^-scrib model has a significat negtive NES.

3. scrib → Wnt3a → JNK, 

Previous research has shown that Scrib can suppress the JNK signaling pathway[^Uhlirova_06][^Ji_19_Disease]. Additionally, the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway can also regulate the JNK signaling pathway. However, there are few papers that have studied the relationship between Scrib, Wnt, and JNK. Previous research has verified that Wnt3a can regulate JNK in a chronic kidney disease model[^Oh_20]. Furthermore, the activity of Wnt3a can be affected by Scrib[^Daulat_19]. Therefore, we have reason to believe that Scrib can regulate JNK through the Wnt signaling pathway. In our reprocessed data, we have found that most Scrib knockdown wing and eye disk tumors show activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, the upregulation of JNK pathway activity has been verified by data source papers[^Ji_19_Disease]. Another piece of evidence comes from the Eye Ras-Scrib tumor, in which the Wnt signaling pathway is significantly upregulated after Bsk knockdown in two independent studies, which could lead to compensatory effects.


4. Wnt → Nkd → JNK.
JNK → App and DNA replication hold

JNK can interact with Wnt through the non-canonical signaling pathway. Nkd inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promotes the JNK signaling pathway[^Rousset_01], leading to both β-catenin and Ras degradation. As a result, the proliferation information is disrupted, and the cell cycle loses control both in drosophila wing disk and human keloid fibroblasts [^Cai_17]. Cells from the wing disc begin overproliferation, which is accompanied by autophagy. Under these circumstances, overexpression of the activated form of Ras (Ras^V12^) could rescue the Ras degradation and compensate for the β-catenin degradation by competitively binding to the degradation complex. Additionally, the downstream gene of the Wnt signaling pathway, c-myc, is upregulated. Meanwhile, Ras can activate the mTor signaling pathway to further promote proliferation and induce a malignant tumor.

5. bsk → Hippo↓

Finally, the JNK signaling pathway could have a cross-talk with Hippo as well. Bsk can suppress Wts's function, which can suppress Yki. After Bsk knockdown, the activity of Hippo is suppressed, and the Wnt signaling pathway is also downregulated by Ras^12v^. At the same time, the JNK signaling pathway is totally lost, and the tumor can be rescued. As a result, Bsk^DN^ can rescue cell proliferation from the Hippo pathway and abnormal cell degradation from the JNK signaling pathway to rescue the effects brought by Ras^V12^ along with Scrib^-^.
