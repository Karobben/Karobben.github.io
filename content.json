Metabolism Database Lipid database: Lipid maps[2] A free resource sponsored by the Wellcome Trust Click me to show more The LIPID MAPS consortium has developed a number of online tools for performing tasks such as drawing lipid structures and predicting possible structures from mass spectrometry (MS) data. A simple online interface has been developed to enable an end-user to rapidly generate a variety of lipid chemical structures, along with corresponding systematic names and ontological information. The structure-drawing tools are available for six categories of lipids: (i) fatty acyls, (ii) glycerolipids, (iii) glycerophospholipids, (iv) cardiolipins, (v) sphingolipids and (vi) sterols. Within each category, the structure-drawing tools support the specification of various parameters such as chain lengths at a specific sn position, head groups, double bond positions and stereochemistry to generate a specific lipid structure. The structure-drawing tools have also been integrated with a second set of online tools which predict possible lipid structures from precursor-ion and product-ion MS experimental data. The MS prediction tools are available for three categories of lipids: (i) mono/di/triacylglycerols, (ii) glycerophospholipids and (iii) cardiolipins.

Work sterile. Grow plate overnight at 37°C. Day 2 Autoclave: 1 L LB (or your preferred media) 1 L of 100 mM CaCl2 1 L of 100 mM MgCl2 100 mL of 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v 4 centrifuge bottles and caps Lots of microfuge tubes Chill overnight at 4°C: 100 mM CaCl2 100 mM MgCl2 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v Centrifuge rotor Prepare starter culture of cells Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 10 mL starter culture of LB (or your preferred media – no antibiotics). Grow culture at 37°C in shaker overnight. Notes: • You will have extra CaCl2 and MgCl2. These solutions can be saved and reautoclaved for the next time you make competent cells. • You can also substitute other media like SOB, 2xYT, etc. for the LB if you prefer. • All glassware should be detergent free. Presence of detergent reduces competency of cells. Day 3 Inoculate 1 L of LB media with 10 mL starter culture and grow in 37°C shaker. Measure the OD600 every hour, then every 15-20 minutes when the OD gets above 0.2. When the OD600 reaches 0.35-0.4, immediately put the cells on ice. Chill the culture for 20-30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling. Place centrifuge bottles on ice at this time. IMPORTANT NOTES: • It is important not to let the OD get any higher than 0.4. The OD should be carefully monitored and checked often, especially when it gets above 0.2, as the cells grow exponentially. It usually takes about 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35 when using a 10 mL starter culture. • It is also very important to keep the cells at 4°C for the remainder of the procedure. The cells, and any bottles or solutions that they come in contact with, must be pre-chilled to 4°C. (Spin #1) Split the 1 L culture into four parts by pouring about 250 mL into ice cold centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000g (~4000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet in about 100 mL of ice cold MgCl2. Combine all suspensions into one centrifuge bottle. Make sure to prepare a blank bottle as a balance. (Spin #2) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g (~3000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in about 200 mL of ice cold CaCl2. Keep this suspension on ice for at least 20 minutes. Start putting 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice if not already chilled. (Spin #3) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g (~3000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C. At this step, rinse a 50 mL conical tube with ddH2O and chill on ice. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in ~50 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol. Transfer the suspension to the 50 mL conical tube. (Spin #4) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2100 rpm in the Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol. The final OD600 of the suspended cells should be ~ 200-250.

I heard that bwa was more suitable for short reads align, so it is frequently used in the miRNA-Seq pipeline. Bowtie is faster and can do better on longer reads alignment. According to this, if your reads are short like 50~70bp, you can choose bwa. If your reads are paired from 150~300bp, bowtie2 would work better. In the post from David, 2015; the best short-reads alignment tool is segemehl. Meanwhile, bwa was more sensitive than bowtie2.

Therefore, if A is the probability of subjects affected and B is probability of subjects not affected, then odds = A /B. Therefore, the odds of rolling four on a dice are 1/5 or 20%. Odds Ratio (OR) is a measure of association between exposure and an outcome. The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. Important points about Odds ratio: Calculated in case-control studies as incidence of outcome is not known OR &gt;1 indicates increased occurrence of event OR &lt;1 indicates decreased occurrence of event (protective exposure) Look at CI and P value for statistical significance of value In rare outcomes OR = RR (RR = Relative Risk). This applies when the incidence of disease is &lt; 10% CLINICAL EXAMPLE AND CALCULATION In a study examining the association between estrogen (exposure) and endometrial carcinoma (outcome), the two by two table is shown below. Learning point: In a two by two table, for ease of calculation ensure that the outcome of interest is always at the top and the exposure on the left. annotations: cite from: psychscenehub copyright belongs to the psychscenehub.com","link":"/2020/07/28/Bioinfor/OddsRatio/"},{"title":"QIIME2","text":"QIIME2 還沒更新 ## 激活工作环境，需要几十秒source activate qiime2-2017.6## 检查是否安装成功，弹出程序帮助即成功qiime --help## 关闭工作环境：不用时关闭，不然你其它程序可能会出错source deactivate","link":"/2020/07/28/Bioinfor/QIIME2/"},{"title":"Entrez Direct: E-utilities on the UNIX Command Line","text":"Entrez Direct: E-utilities on the UNIX Command Line Install cd ~/bin/bashperl -MNet::FTP -e \\ '$ftp = new Net::FTP(&quot;ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;, Passive =&gt; 1); $ftp-&gt;login; $ftp-&gt;binary; $ftp-&gt;get(&quot;/entrez/entrezdirect/edirect.tar.gz&quot;);'gunzip -c edirect.tar.gz | tar xf -rm edirect.tar.gzbuiltin exitexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/edirect &gt;&amp; /dev/null || setenv PATH &quot;${PATH}:$HOME/edirect&quot;./edirect/setup.sh or, you can using Bioconda conda install -c bioconda entrez-direct Cookbook Origin: NCBI-Hackathons (Archive) Best Practices for EDirect: Please keep to &lt;50,000 expected hits (it simply won’t work) Please do not run from multiple processors on a compute farm Update to latest version For more information and documentation on EDirect, please see: Entrez Direct: E-utilities on the Unix Command Line Insiders Guide to Accessing NLM Data: EDirect Overview All items below come with no explicit or implicit warranty.

The difference between this to parameters are explained in --help # --gene_trans_map file containing 'gene(tab)transcript' identifiers per line. # or # --trinity_mode Setting --trinity_mode will automatically generate the gene_trans_map and use it. After down, you’ll got a bunch of result. The abaundance file was in the directories miR-31_rep1, miR-31_rep2, Scr-2_rep1, Scr-2_rep2 as the statistic scripts, the result was divided into two groups, gene and isoforms: RSEM.genes.results RSEM.isoforms.results. This is where the count, TPM, and FPKM were generated and stored (If you are using RSEM).

Bowtie2 align reads from -U into indexed reference from -x and bowtie2.bam was created. After that, bowtie2.bam.ok was touched to mark this process is done bam was converted into bowtie2.bam.for_rsem.bam and started counting by using RSEM index Expression matrix Of course that trinity supplied a script, abundance_estimates_to_matrix.pl, do it for you as well. ~/Bio/trinityrnaseq-v2.12.0/util/abundance_estimates_to_matrix.pl --est_method RSEM \\ --gene_trans_map trinity_out_dir.Trinity.fasta.gene_trans_map \\ --out_prefix RSEM \\ --name_sample_by_basedir \\ Scr-2_rep1/RSEM.isoforms.results \\ Scr-2_rep2/RSEM.isoforms.results \\ miR-31_rep1/RSEM.isoforms.results \\ miR-31_rep2/RSEM.isoforms.results # my results of prefix is RSEMls RSEM* RSEM.gene.TMM.EXPR.matrix RSEM.gene.counts.matrix RSEM.isoform.TPM.not_cross_norm.runTMM.R RSEM.gene.TPM.not_cross_norm RSEM.isoform.TMM.EXPR.matrix RSEM.isoform.counts.matrix RSEM.gene.TPM.not_cross_norm.TMM_info.txt RSEM.isoform.TPM.not_cross_norm RSEM.gene.TPM.not_cross_norm.runTMM.R RSEM.isoform.TPM.not_cross_norm.TMM_info.txt Now, all the matrix were extracted from separated results of samples. move them into a new directory mkdir RSEM_resultmv RSEM* RSEM_result Errors libreadline /home/ken/miniconda3/envs/Biostation/lib/R/bin/exec/R: error while loading shared libraries: libreadline.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory chech the libreadlines: ls /lib/libreadline.* /lib/libreadline.so /lib/libreadline.so.8 /lib/libreadline.so.8.1 The problem is this script is relying on an very old version.

You can achive this by using R. Trinity supplied the related scripts to handle with this, too. This is the function in R to down the same thing as the scripts from Trinity A &lt;- read.table(&quot;RSEM.isoform.TPM.not_cross_norm&quot;)Filter &lt;- function(A, Th){ tmp = A for(i in c(1:ncol(A))){ tmp = tmp[which(tmp[,i] &lt; Th),] } return(tmp)} In trinity, perl scripts, util/misc/count_matrix_features_given_MIN_TPM_threshold.pl, is aiming to that the genes/isoforms expressed above a minimum TPM expression threshold in any sample. ~/Bio/trinityrnaseq-v2.12.0/util/misc/count_matrix_features_given_MIN_TPM_threshold.pl \\ RSEM.isoform.TPM.not_cross_norm neg_min_tpm num_features -6771 1 -6758 2 -6185 3 -6092 4 . . . -4 36909 -3 41004 -2 42353 -1 42440 0 42451 In this result, -1 42440 means that 42440 isoforms’s TPM is larger than 1 in all samples.

Unsigned Network and Signed Network Unsigned network: The value is from -1 to 1. (Both -1 and 1 means adjacent is 0, strongly correlated) Both high value and low (nagetive) value are correlated because of adjacent. Singed network: The correlation value is form 0-1. From unsigned correlation to singed network, Q&amp;A Reference: Peter 2017 Data Analysis Questions How many samples do I need? At least for 15 samples. More samples could robust and refined results. Noises may can’t be removed if you have less samples. Should I filter probesets or genes? Filtering genes by DEGs is not recommended since it completely invalidates the scale-free topology assumption, which is the indicator of the soft thresholding power. On the other hand, filtering gene by DE will lead to a set of correlated genes that will essentially form a single (or few high correlated) module respectively. What argument (option) settings are recommended? In general, we attempt to select suitable default which feat multiple applications and also, it is high reproducible. While for new calculations, you can customize argument. Signed Network The choice of Signed or Unsigned network is complicate, but generally, we prefer the Signed network. To construct Signed Networks, we usring: type = &quot;signed&quot; or type = &quot;signed hybrid&quot; in function such as accuracyMeasures, adjacency, chooseOneHubInEachModule, chooseTopHubInEachModule, nearestNeighborConnectivity, nearestNeighborConnectivityMS, orderBranchesUsingHubGenes, softConnectivity. Some functions useing networkType to select the signed. Robust correlation Generaly, we recommend to using default arguments to detect the correlation unless you have enough reason to believe there is no outlier measurment. You can using corFnc, cor, et al. to customizing your own detective. For more, please go to Tutorial Can WGCNA be used to analyze RNA-Seq data? Peter： Yes. As far as WGCNA is concerned, working with (properly normalized) RNA-seq data isn’t really any different from working with (properly normalized) microarray data. Suggestion: Removing low hits transcripts. Low counting transcripts tend to reflect noise. (for example, removing all features that have a count of less than say 10 in more than 90% of the samples) Normalization varianceStabilizingTransformation from DESeq2 is really useful. RPKM and FPKM is helpful, too. We can also using log2(x+1). Notions: Different algorithms have huge impact on the result of expression change, but have limit affect on WGCNA. Id data comes from different batch, We can use ComBat (Exp: 木头的博客) for batch effect removal. Finally, we usually check quantile scatterplots to make sure there are no systematic shifts between samples; if sample quantiles show correlations (which they usually do), quantile normalization can be used to remove this effect. Data heterogeneous Data heterogeneous can effect any statistical analysis. (Skip) Soft-thresholding power can’t get a good scale-free topology index no matter how high I set the soft-thresholding power. First, the user should ensure that variables (probesets, genes etc.) have not been filtered by differential expression with respect to a sample trait. Probability: Checking the clustering tree (exp); strong clusters in the tree indicates globally different groups of sample. It may caused by batch effects or heterogenous. Carefully adjust the samples before building topology index. If the one causing heterogenous you don’t remove, you can still chosen the soft thresholding power by the number of samples at table below.

Julian Epigenetics and alternative splicing Splicing and transcription can be regulated by epigenetic modifications, such as alterations in histone and DNA structures[1][2]. The organization of chromatin can regulate the splicing process by influencing the availability and recruitment of splicing factors[3].

The statistical model of MATS calculates the P-value and false discovery rate that the difference in the isoform ratio of a gene between two conditions exceeds a given user-defined threshold. From the RNA-Seq data, MATS can automatically detect and analyze alternative splicing events corresponding to all major types of alternative splicing patterns. MATS handles replicate RNA-Seq data from both paired and unpaired study design. (© Xing Lab) © Xing Lab Unpaired Replicates. Other Related Tools MISO, SpliceTrap, ALEXA- seq, and rSeqDiff are designed for two-sample com- parison and do not handle replicates. Cufflinks, FDM, and DiffSplice use the Jensen–Shannon divergence metric to detect differential isoform proportion while accounting for vari- ability among replicates.

However, this can be prone to errors. Based on my experience, there are several factors that should be considered: It is recommended that each position should have its own directory, as the tool generates an index for that position which may not update even if the parameters are changed. It is possible to assign a random position, but it is preferable to assign a position based on the position of exons. If there are no genes located within the region that has been specified, an error will occur. png result It appears that the rmats2sashimiplot tool is not capable of producing the result as a PNG image format. As a solution, we can use other tools such as pdftoppm to convert the generated PDF file to the PNG format. For instance, a command example to convert a file named p1.pdf to a PNG file named p1.png with a resolution of 1000 can be: pdftoppm p1.pdf p1.png -png -r 1000.

Why different: If you’re looking at transcription factors, then you should use a peak finder like MACS (http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/) to search for enrichment of your TF compared to a background samples such as input or no-ab control. If however, you are profiling a fairly well characterised histone mark such as H3K9ac or H3K4me3 then you can simply count the reads that map near the promoters as a proxy for gene activation/repression.

Before doing this, I spend a few hours to taught myself about Mysql and recorded all my notes at blog Please feel free to check the Mysql grammar before running codes below if you are an newbies like me. I’ll start to do this with few questions: Why I’d like to build a database What I database I’d like to have Which features does this DB will have Why and What Generally, I am writing a paper about the diet-switch experiment which has a few RNA-seq data-set. It could give me a great help if there is a database which targeted to the diet-gene interaction. But, I can’t find a one. Though, I know that gene regulated by nutrition effect could mostly contributed to of the effects like immune system depress, stress response, etc. But it do help researches focusing the interactions they may interested rather than searching blindly among more than 20 thousands of genes from RNA-seq or other high-throughput results. So, I decided to write a database which target to the how the genes responded to nutrition effects. Due to the limited of the experience and capability, I’ll store the well verified and reliable data, WB and qPCR for instance, only and maybe I’ll considerate the NGS data in the feature. It could be very fun to deal with large quantity of data, you know, as a user, definitely not a manager.

It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. BWA-backtrack: It is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, BWA-MEM: BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support (70bp to 1Mbp) and split alignment. It is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. It also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads. QS There are three algorithms, which one should I choose? For 70bp or longer Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent and Sanger reads, assembly contigs and BAC sequences, BWA-MEM is usually the preferred algorithm. For short sequences, BWA-backtrack may be better. BWA-SW may have better sensitivity when alignment gaps are frequent. What is the tolerance of sequencing errors? Bwa-back is mainly designed for sequencing error rates below 2%. WA-SW and BWA-MEM both tolerate more errors given longer alignment. Simulation suggests that they may work well given 2% error for an 100bp alignment, 3% error for a 200bp, 5% for 500bp and 10% for 1000bp or longer alignment. Does BWA find chimeric reads? Yes, both BWA-SW and BWA-MEM are able to find chimera. BWA usually reports one alignment for each read but may output two or more alignments if the read/contig is a chimera. Does BWA work on reference sequences longer than 4GB in total? Yes. Since 0.6.x, all BWA algorithms work with a genome with total length over 4GB. However, individual chromosome should not be longer than 2GB. PS chimeric reads: Chimeric reads occur when one sequencing read aligns to two distinct portions of the genome with little or no overlap. Chimeric reads are indicative of structural variation. Chimeric reads are also called split reads. After aligning with bwa mem, chimeric reads will have an SA tag as described on page 7 of the SAM format specification. To find them all you have to do is extract them using grep. donfreed, 2014. In the documentation, it mentioned that bwa aln is for find the SA reads. Bowtie2 Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes. What isn’t Bowtie 2? Bowtie 2 is geared toward aligning relatively short sequencing reads to long genomes. That said, it handles arbitrarily small reference sequences (e.g. amplicons) and very long reads (i.e. upwards of 10s or 100s of kilobases), though it is slower in those settings. It is optimized for the read lengths and error modes yielded by typical Illumina sequencers. Bowtie 2 does not support alignment of colorspace reads. (Bowtie 1 does.) Documentation Bowtie2 could awareness splicing because it cut reads into even shorter before doing alignment. PS What is colorspace reads: Short answer: color space refers to the native format of ABI SoLID technology. Color space is translated to nucleotide, or base space (same thing) so that it can be understood. That technology is not growing in market share, so in the next few years it will become less common. ABI is putting most of their effort behind the Ion Torrent now. swbarnes2, 2012 Test Data >1_Perfect_match TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >2_Intron_insertion TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATTGCTGATCGATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTACGTGCATCAGTCGATCAGTACGTCAGATGCTGTCGATCGTAGTCGATCGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCATAGTAGCTGCATGCTAGCTGCTAGCTCAGTAGCTCGTGCATGCATGCATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >3_Intron_insertion TAATTCCCATGCTGATCGTGACTGCTGATCGATCGTGCTAGTCGATGCTCGTGCATGCTGCATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGACTGATCGTACGTCAGTGCATGCATGCTAGCTAGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTCAGTCAGTCAGTCGATCGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGTCGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTCAGTCAGTAGCTCAGTCGAGCTGTGTGTGCTAGCACTACGTGTCGATGTGTCAGTAGATGAAGTTCCTGATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >4_Cross_Chrm_L TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATTGCTGATCGATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTACGTGCATCAGTCGATCAGTACGTCAG >5_Cross_Chrm_R ATGCTGTCGATCGTAGTCGATCGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCATAGTAGCTGCATGCTAGCTGCTAGCTCAGTAGCTCGTGCATGCATGCATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >6_Small_deletion_3 TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >6_deletion_10 TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >6_deletion_20 TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCTGTGGCCGCC >7_Samll_insertion_3 TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATGATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC >8_SNP TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATTATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC Build reference DB (index) module load trinity/2.8.5module load bwamodule load bowtie2module load rsemfor i in $(grep &quot;&gt;&quot; Ref.fa|sed 's/&gt;//'); do grep -A 1 $i Ref.fa &gt; $i.fa; donefor i in $(ls *.fa);do bwa index $i bowtie2-build $i $i bowtie-build $i $idone Aligning for i in $(ls DB/*.fa) do SAMPLE=$(echo $i| sed 's=DB/=='); bwa mem $i test.fq | grep -v ^@ &gt; $SAMPLE.bwa.sam bowtie2 -x $i -U test.fq|grep -v ^@ &gt; $SAMPLE.bowtie2.sam bowtie $i test.fq|grep -v ^@ &gt; $SAMPLE.bowtie.samdonegrep . *.sam| sed 's/.sam:/\\t/'|awk -F&quot;\\t&quot; '{print $1&quot;\\t&quot;$4}' | awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $1&quot;\\t&quot;$NF}'&gt; Result Results Format of sam file: A00327:224:HW2JVDRXY:1:1101:1253:1000 0 1_Perfect_match 1 60 50M * 0 0 TAATTCCCAAGATGAAGTTCCTGATCATCCTTGCCCTGGCTGTGGCCGCC #FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF NM:i:0 MD:Z:50 AS:i:50 XS:i:0 Columns Abbr.

Because if we have the variation files, we can call the genes based on the location of reference gtf. And we even don’t need to assemble our genomes. Cons: - We have only SNP information - Structure variation like inversion and duplication cannot be found. Genome Annotation One of easiest way to extract genes from non-annotated Genome is annotate it. MITOS WebServer. In this server, you just need to submit your fasta file and wait.

Here’s the dataset: Gene S1 S2 S3 A 1 2 1 B 2 4 1 C 3 6 2 D 4 8 3 E 1 2 1 F 2 4 1 The first step in GSEA is to rank the genes based on their correlation with the phenotype of interest. In this example, we will use the sum of expression values across samples as the phenotype. The ranked list of genes based on this phenotype is: Gene Rank D 15 C 11 B 7 F 7 A 4 E 4 The second step is to calculate an enrichment score for the gene set “MySet” by walking down the ranked list of genes, and computing a running sum of the signed correlation between each gene and the phenotype. If a gene is in “MySet”, its correlation is positive; otherwise, it is negative. The enrichment score is the maximum deviation from zero of the running sum. Here’s the calculation: Gene Rank In MySet? Correlation Running Sum D 15 No -1 -1 C 11 No -1 -2 B 7 Yes +1 -1 F 7 Yes +1 0 A 4 Yes +1 1 E 4 No -1 0 The maximum deviation from zero of the running sum is 1, which occurs at gene A. Therefore, the enrichment score for “MySet” is 1. This example demonstrates the basic steps of GSEA, but in practice, GSEA is often applied to much larger datasets and gene sets, and the significance of the enrichment score is assessed using statistical tests such as permutation tests or gene set permutation tests. GESA In clusterProfiler, there are functions designed to do GESA based on GO and KEGG gene sets. Here I am trying to show you how to do GESA with your customized data set. There are two main functions which are GSEA from clusterProfiler and fgsea from fgsea.

However, when you are evaluating multiple gene sets, you must correct for gene set size and multiple hypothesis testing. Because the p value is not adjusted for either, it is of limited value when comparing gene sets. The FDR is adjusted for gene set size and multiple hypotheses testing while the p value is not. When a top gene set has a small nominal p value and a high FDR value, it generally indicates that it is not as significant when compared with other gene sets in the empirical null distribution. This could be because you do not have enough samples, the biological signal is subtle, or the gene sets do not represent the biology in question very well. On the other hand, the FDR is based on two distributions of all gene sets; if only one of many gene sets is enriched, that gene set is likely to have a high FDR. Finally, a top gene set with a high nominal p value and a low FDR value, generally indicates a negative result: the gene set itself is not significant and other sets are weaker. In the GSEA report, a p value of zero (0.0) indicates an actual p value of less than 1/number-of-permutations. For example, if the analysis performed 100 permutations, a reported p value of 0.0 indicates an actual p value of less than 0.01. For a more accurate p value, increase the number of permutations performed by the analysis. Typically, you will want to perform 1000 permutations (phenotype or gene_set). (If you attempt to perform significantly more than 1000 permutations, GSEA may run out of memory.) From: © gsea-msigdb.org More FAQ could be found at: software.broadinstitute.org Other things you need to know ES (enrichment score): reflects the degree to which a gene-set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes. NES (normalized enrichment score): NES corrects for differences in ES between gene-sets due to differences in gene-set sizes. It enables to compare the scores of the different tested gene-sets with each other. NES = actual ES / mean of all ESs obtained from all random permutations for the single gene-set that is being tested nom p-value: The nominal p value estimates the statistical significance of the enrichment score for a single gene set. The p-value is calculated from the null distribution. Using gene-set permutation, the null distribution is created by generating, for each permutation, a random gene set the same size as your specified gene set by selecting that number of genes from all of the genes in your expression data set (or pre-ranked list), and then calculating the enrichment score for that randomly selected gene set. The distribution of those enrichment scores across all of the permutations constitutes the null distribution. FDR: corrects for multiple hypothesis testing and enable a more correct comparison of the different tested gene-sets with each other. note: for a given gene-set S and observed NES, called NES*, FDR is [% of all NES (including permutations) &gt;= NES*] / [% of all observed NES (=NES for all tested gene-sets) &gt;= NES*] relationships between ES, pvalue , NES and FDR: pvalue is calculated from ES FDR is calculated from NES the higher the ES or NES and the lowest the FDR or pvalue NES above 1.4 will usually give significant results © BADER LAB, 2016 pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2022/10/03/Bioinfor/gsea/"},{"title":"IdTrackerAI","text":"Set up/Install Documentation how to install correct pytorch and cuda: https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ conda create -y --name idtrackerai python=3.7 Tensorflow=2.0.0 cudatoolkit=11.3.1 pytorch=1.10.0conda activate idtrackeraipip install &quot;idtrackerai[gui]&quot; General information for utility As shown above, the interface is very user-friendly.

It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate [MD:M00001]. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate [MD:M00307]. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module [MD:M00002], which is found in almost all organisms and which sometimes contains operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths [MD:M00003].

Though we can get well quantified data by running alternative splicing processing. But the structure and the number of isoforms for each gene are kind of ambiguous. By de-novo transcripts assembling, we can technically get the full length of the transcripts and we may find some new transcripts and even new genes. Also, gene fusion could be easily told and illustrated. With some help from other tools, blast+ for instance, we can visualize them very well when against them to a reference genome and other standard isoforms. The bad side of the approach is that there is a high false positive rate. My previous sequencing experience tells me that some transcripts may never be detected even by PCR. And the transcripts could look weird because they might be fused with other genes, LncRNA, miRNA, etc., to form a very long and unreliable form. Also, you may never find a transcript from the standard isoform even from the control. And sometimes you can find the intron region is not appropriately spliced. But those are all normal and possible. Because the Trinity algorithm is not perfect. Those “abnormal” transcripts could be a false positive result or something different does happen here and have some biological meanings. But most of the time, I believe the first result. As a result, though this tech might looks fancy and could get a very beautiful result, it is worthy to be verified by other means and be talked very carefully.

Robinson, Davis J. McCarthy, Gordon K. Smyth, edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data, Bioinformatics, Volume 26, Issue 1, 1 January 2010, Pages 139–140, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616 An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. Why EdgeR For microarrays, the abundance of a particular transcript is measured as afluorescence intensity, effectively a continuous response Digital gene expression (DGE) data the abundance is observed as a count Therefore, procedures that are successful for microarray data are not directly applicable to DGE data . edgeR is designed for the analysis of replicated count-based expression data and is an implementation of methology developed by Robinson and Smyth[1][2]. It initially developed for serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) As a result, edgeR may also be useful in other experiments that generate counts, such as ChIP-seq, in proteomics experiments where spectral counts are used to summarize the peptide abundance[3] or in barcoding experiments where several species are counted [4]. Digital gene expression: Digital gene expression (DGE) is a sequence-based approach for gene expression analyses, that generates a digital output at an unparalleled level of sensitivity[5]. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE): Serial analysis of gene expression, or SAGE, is an experimental technique designed to gain a direct and quantitative measure of gene expression. The SAGE method is based on the isolation of unique sequence tags (9-10 bp in length) from individual mRNAs and concatenation of tags serially into long DNA molecules for a lump-sum sequencing[6]. Spam test Spam test2 Method In limma (Smyth, 2004), where an empirical Bayes model is used to moderate the probe-wise variances. In edgeR: We assume the data can be summarized into a table of counts We model the data as negative binomial (NB) distributed $$ Y_ {gi} \\sim NB(M_ i p_ {gj},\\phi_g) $$ For gene $_ g$ and sample $_ i$: $M_i$: the library size (total number of reads), $ϕ_g$: the dispersion $p _{gj}$: is the relative abundance of gene $_g$ in experimental group $_j$ to which sample $_i$ belongs. We use the NB parameterization where: the mean is $\\mu_ {gi} = M_ i p_ {gj}$ the variance is $μ_ {gi}(1+ \\mu _ {gi} \\phi _g)$ For differential expression analysis: the parameters of interest are $p_ {gj}$. The NB distribution is reduced to Poisson when $ \\phi_g = 0$. In some DGE applications, technical variation can be treated as Poisson. In general, $\\phi_g$ represents the coefficient of variation of biological variation between the samples. In this way, our model is able to separate biological from technical variation. limma: dispersion estimates -&gt; topTags: tabulate the top differentially expressed genes -&gt; plotSmear: MA plot More There are a few terms and algorithms I do not understand.

Normalized counts are the most popular unit among differential expression analysis methods (including edgeR). However, feature length normalization is skipped, with the important consequence that within-sample differential feature expression analysis is not possible.

According to Dillies[2], normalization algorithms could be divided into two groups: library size concept (TMM and DESeq) or distribution adjustment of read counts (Total Counts, RPKM, Quantile from limma). The hypothesis of TMMP and DESeq is that most of genes are not DE and the both propose a scaling factor based on a mean, median, or ratio. Based on Real data and simulated date, TMM and DESeq’s performance are acceptable, but RPKM and total counts of genes are not suggested to be used on the down stream analysis[2:1][1:1]. On the other hand, RPKM, FPKM, and TPM tend to perform poorly when transcript distribution differ between samples[3]. In another reseach, the title is without replicates RNA-Seq, but the data set is triplicates shows that the results from TMM, RLE, and MRN are really similar[4]. And for more complicated comparison, MRN might be better[5]. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; } Zhao, Y., Li, MC., Konaté, M.M. et al. TPM, FPKM, or Normalized Counts?

You can use the score cut-off to limit the number of interactions to those that have higher confidence and are more likely to be true positives. Setting the cutoff lower will increase coverage but also a fraction of false positives. You have to choose some arbitrary number based on the number of interactions you need for your analysis.

And most of them are contributed by microbes. A Gouin, et al., 2014[1] studied those unmapped reads from 33 plants and believed that those sequences may contribute to the divergence between host plant specialized biotypes. To identify those unmapped reads, lots of pipelines and tools are developed. Mara Sangiovanni, 2019[2] published the DecontaMiner for investigating the presence of contamination. Zifan Zhu, 2019[3] released MicroPro to study the know and unknown microbes based on the unmapped reads. Not only in DNA-seq, but RNA-seq could also find lots of unmapped reads and they could be meaningful, too. Artur Gurgul, et al., 2022 [4] found those unmapped reads not only comes from contamination but also come from the hosts and could be used to refine the reference genome. For example, Majid Kazemian, 2015[5] find lots of new or abnormal transcripts from human cancer RNA-seq. A few de novo contigs from unmapped reads could not align to humans but other few kinds of Primates have positive effects on the tumor cell. Possible sources of unmapped reads: Biology Issue Human (From the technician) symbionts/pathogens Viruses Bacteria fungi other parasites (exp, mites) repetitive elements (some alignment tools would ignore them)[4:1] genetic variation SCGB1A1 gene(RNA-seq) [4:2] absent or misassembled in the reference genome[6] Not well-identified Genes[4:3] non-coding RNA (RNA-seq)[4:4] Technical Issue primer-dimer formation[7] Cloning/Expression Vecters Once we realized the existence and significance of unmapped reads, we need to find a way to annotate and analyze them.

Papudeshi; 2018 Unmapped human RNA-Seq data and their association with cancer © Majid Kazemian, 2015 Exploring the unmapped DNA and RNA reads in a songbird genome © Veronika N. Laine, 2015 About Bracken Jen Lu; 2017: If a 150bp read is 100% identical to two different species, Kraken will assign it to their lowest common ancestor (LCA), which could be at the genus level or higher. But some reads within a particular sample usually come from the unique (or species-specific) portion of the genome. Bracken uses this information, plus information about the similarity between the sister species, to “push down” reads from the genus level to the species level. Other background information: Challenges in benchmarking metagenomic profilers; Nature Methods To be notices, Kraken2 and Bracken is DNA-to-DNA strategy. The abundance of the reads is relative to the nucleotide, not species individual. © Zheng Sun, 2021 Why Kraken Lu J., et al. showed that comparing to QiiMe, Kraken2 has uncompetable speed in annotation and the results from kraken-bracken are even better than QiiMe[8]. I think it’s time for QiiMe move a room for Kraken2 now. © Lu J.

Technically, you can find the unmapped reads by samtools view *.bam| awk '$3==&quot;*&quot;'. But I don’t know why the number of reads is less than the result from samtools stats. So, the easiest way to achieve this is: Single end: samtools fastq -@ 8 -f 4 Bam/S10_aln_pe_bqsr.bam &gt; s.fq.gz Paired end: samtools fastq -@ 8 -f 4 Bam/10_aln_pe_bqsr.bam -1 1.fq.gz -2 2.fq.gz -s s.fq.gz In this code, reads would be split into 3 files: 1.fq.gz, 2.fq.gz, and s.fq.gz. The first two are paired reads and the 3rd is unpaired reads. In Kraken classification under paired parameter, unpaired reads in fq file would be ignored. So, we need to store them independently and run kraken twice. If some samples are single ends, the result cannot be stored with this command. But the reads would be printed into log file: Log/*.out. So, we can compress it into fq.gz module load samtoolsSUFFIX=_aln_pe_bqsr.bamBAM=BamOUT_dir=FQ_unmappedmkdir $OUT_dir script Logfor i in $(ls $BAM/*.bam); do SAMPLE=$(echo $i| awk -F&quot;/&quot; '{print $NF}'| sed &quot;s/$SUFFIX//&quot;); if [ -f $OUT_dir/$SAMPLE\\_1.fq.gz ]; then echo $SAMPLE is done else sed &quot;s/Hi/$SAMPLE/&quot; Model.sh &gt; script/$SAMPLE\\_fq.sh echo &quot;samtools fastq -@ 8 -f 4 $i -1 $OUT_dir/$SAMPLE&quot;&quot;_1.fq.gz -2 $OUT_dir/$SAMPLE&quot;&quot;_2.fq.gz -s $OUT_dir/$SAMPLE&quot;&quot;_s.fq.gz&quot; &gt;&gt; script/$SAMPLE\\_fq.sh sbatch script/$SAMPLE\\_fq.sh fidone# Check for Single Endsfor i in $(du Log/*.out | grep -v ^0|awk '{print $2}');do SAMPLE=$(echo $i| sed 's=Log/==;s/.out//') sed &quot;s/Hi/Single_$SAMPLE/&quot; Model.sh &gt; script/$SAMPLE\\_fq_s.sh echo gzip -c $i \\&gt; $OUT_dir/$SAMPLE\\_s.fq.gz &gt;&gt; script/$SAMPLE\\_fq_s.sh sbatch script/$SAMPLE\\_fq_s.shdone# Finally, remove emplty fq filesrm $(du $OUT_dir/*| grep &quot;^4&quot;$'\\t'|awk '{print $2}')# Check the number of samples is correct or notls $OUT_dir/*|sed 's/_[12s].fq.gz//'|sort|uniq |wc -l 131 Here I have 131 samples in total.

作为一个良心开源投屏加控制软件，真是太强大了。 不需要手机安装额外垃圾东西，比自带的手机投屏到电脑功能要稳定很多， 不容易崩溃(某win)。稳定好， 高清画面也不容易掉帧，真是太舒服了。 本来这个软件非常友好啊, 但是却应为deepin 系统的关系, apt源没有, snap在上国又很鸡肋,完全不能用, 只能自己编译。编译就编译吧， 偏偏又有很多的坑要填 = = 我是被虐的不要不要的反正。对于小白来说， configure + make， 还是很友好的， 报错清晰，debug简单。 但是第一次接触mason 和nijia 来说- -有点噩梦了。最开始想着直接下最新的1.12.1， 然后直接编译， 一堆错误。 后面终于通过googel 到了一个全能贴， 发现需要安装服务。按照要求，安装服务器后，又出现了，ninjia 报错说没有找到1.11.1 的服务器。。？？？ 好吧，去下好了1.11.1的， 总算是没有报错了， 输入scrcpy 也成功了， 没有报错。并且和成功运行的画面一样， 手机收到了确认。 但是- - 就是半天不显示画面。。。 没反应了。瞎折腾了几下， 抱着实时心态， 既然报错说1.11.1， 可能是版本对不上 == ？ 索性干脆安装1.11.1的包， 删掉重来。 终于- -唉， 成功了 - - 撒花！！！下面是详细教程： 1.

The error message you provided is related to Hexo, a static site generator. It seems that there was an issue with a submodule named ‘.deploy_git’ in the Git repository you were working with. This error occurs when there’s a problem with the Git submodule in your Hexo project, and it’s not able to be cloned. To resolve this issue, try the following steps: # Remove the problematic submodule:git rm --cached .deploy_git# Commit the changes:git commit -m &quot;Removed problematic submodule&quot;# Re-add the submodule:# Replace &lt;repo&gt; with the URL of the Git repository for the submodule.git submodule add -b master &lt;repo&gt; .deploy_git# Initialize the submodule:git submodule init# Update the submodule:git submodule update These steps should resolve the issue with the Git submodule and allow you to continue using Hexo to generate your static site. If the issue persists, you may need to refer to the Hexo troubleshooting guide (https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting.html) for further assistance. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2020/06/23/Linux/github/"},{"title":"grep 搜索","text":"grep 搜索 grep##Usage: grep [OPTION]...

Slurm requires no kernel modifications for its operation and is relatively self-contained. As a cluster workload manager, Slurm has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work. Optional plugins can be used for accounting, advanced reservation, gang scheduling (time sharing for parallel jobs), backfill scheduling, topology optimized resource selection, resource limits by user or bank account, and sophisticated multifactor job prioritization algorithms.

However, there is a limit to the number of jobs that can be submitted by each user. In such cases, we prefer to hold off on job submission and wait until some of the previously submitted jobs are completed. To achieve this, the easiest way is to use a while loop before submitting the jobs. for i in {1..3000}; do while [ $(squeue -u user| wc -l) -gt 900 ] ;do echo $(squeue -u user| wc -l) too many jobs; sleep 10; done sbatch job.shdone In this while loop, we utilize the command squeue -u user | wc -l to determine the number of jobs in the user’s list. When it exceeds 900, we enter a while loop that will pause the submission process until some jobs have completed. This is a bash script that will submit a batch job (job.sh) 3000 times. However, it will check if there are already 900 or more jobs running under the user account “user” using the squeue command. If there are, it will wait for 10 seconds and check again. This loop will continue until there are fewer than 900 jobs running, at which point it will submit the next batch job using the sbatch command. Here is a breakdown of the code: for i in {1..3000}; do starts a loop that will run 3000 times. This is just a counter and is not used in the loop. while [ $(squeue -u user| wc -l) -gt 900 ] ;do starts a while loop that will continue as long as there are 900 or more jobs running under the user account “user”. echo $(squeue -u user| wc -l) too many jobs; prints a message to the console indicating how many jobs are currently running. sleep 10; pauses the script for 10 seconds before checking again. sbatch job.sh submits the batch job job.sh to the queue for processing. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2022/09/22/Linux/slurm/"},{"title":"Compress and Decompress","text":"tar ##reference:https://man.linuxde.net/tar Compress: tar -zcvf File.tar.gz File Decompress: tar - zxvf File.tar.gz Format Decompress compress .tar xvf cvf .tar.gz zxvf zcvf .tar.bz2 jxvf jcvf .tar.bz jxvf .tar.Z .tar.Z .tar.Z Tar with ssh to substitute scp This pipe could help you upload large files much faster than scp.

I can’t exactly remember the contents but it left a good impression for me. So, I decided to finish it and make some notes now. Chapter 6: Race and Ancestry It is interesting to know about our biological race from DNA testing. It may look cool if the biological identity feat your social identity and could have a positive effect on you, like the girl known that she has Native American DNA and made a closer relationship with other native Americans. The problem is that when the biological identity collided with your social identity, Wayne Joseph for instance, who was identified as African American and advocating for this group but actually has no DNA comes from Africa. It just like you are been told that your father is not your biological father or your son/daughter is not yours. It is hard to imaging for us cause we humans have and need a strong sense of belonging. Japanese believe that their intestine is longer for Westerners for fitting the rice diet rather than bread. As a result, they suggested that ban American beef since it is not suitable for the Japanese intestine. Biological identity &amp; Social identify, why is it matters? Statistics show: people who read about races is the product of the social culture rather than gene are more willing to make friends with Blacks. Asian Americans read about race is the product of the social culture rather than gene are more confident to blend in American culture and community. Author has divided the topics of social &amp; biological effects. For me, I prefer to take them as a whole. One should be the product of the interaction between natural and nurture. But it is too complicated to talk about the knowledge we have at present. And maybe this is why the author prefers to talking with them respectively in this book o. Chapter 7: Essences and the Seductive Allure of Eugenics In the western world, eugenic is a contemptuous idea since it connected the Nazis. But it is much temper in Asian areas. Intelligence and Essences The experiment about comprising or disorganizing students made different consequences on American students and Japanese students. American students preferred to gain confidence from the comprises and try to practice the same project because they believe they are good at it. But people who were criticized prefer to picking up other works and give up what they don’t good at. But the controversial results present at Japanese students who prefer to practice more with the project which had negative feedback. This is interesting. Because though teachers and parents are debated about this topic for many years but almost none of them are holding the view from students. If they are restricted to their personal experience and may cause problems on their students, like prevent their students to make progress or give up the project too early. How Heritable is IQ? The author mentioned about the difference in heritability of IQ among wealthier and poor populations. The index is as high as 80% in wealthier communities but as low as 10% in poor groups. It is interesting to see that those two groups have such disparity. And this is the reason why I’m always taking care of all kinds of statistic reports or results weather are they significantly or not. As I always said, I strongly believe that humans are the product of the interaction of DNA and environment. For the first sight, I thought that one possibility is that the most of wealthier parents were well educated and so, they have touched their limits of IQ. As a result, their offspring are closing to them. For poor communities, some of them are not well educated, or may even have poor health. Both of these can affect the results of the IQ test. On the other hand, education is easy to get compared with the old days and so, developed (educated) kids were easy to show smarter than their parents who are far from to touch their IQ limits.","link":"/2020/07/25/LearnNotes/DNA_Is_NotDestiny/"},{"title":"English Vocabularies and Sentences about fish tank","text":"English Vocabularies and Sentences about fish tank 欢迎评论，或者补充～评论不了可以B站私信我: 史上最不正經的生物狗 Source: AQUAPROS 2019[1] English Chinese string algae 丝藻 Moss 莫斯 Prune (Pruning) 修剪 garden aquarium 草缸 cory fish 鼠鱼 farm 渔场 quarantine 隔离 a school of fish 鱼群 nano fish 小鱼 cyano(bacteria) 蓝藻(蓝细菌) scraper 刮刀 dwarf hair grass plecos 清道夫 snails 螺 A big pile of Moss BiliBili: 史上最不正經的生物狗 AQUAPROS 2019; Adding 300 FISH!

Will, because we are not monkeys, we are fish. Now, knowing you are a fish and not a monkey is actually really important to understanding where we came from. I teach one of the largest evolution biological class in the US, and when my students finally understand why I am call them fish all the time, then, I know, I am getting my job done. But I always have to start my classes by dispelling something hardwired myth, because that was really knowing it, many of us were taught evolution wrong. For instance, we are taught to say the theory of evolution, there are actually many theories, and just like the process itself, the one that best fit the data are the one that survive to this day. The one we know best it Darwin Natural Selection. That’s the processes by which organism that best fit the environment to survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fitted, slowly die off. And that’s it. Evolution as simple as that, And it is the facts. Evolution is a facts as much as the theory of gravity. You can prove it just easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share with all other life on Earth. Those trace doesn’t pop up in humans. There are past down from different ancestor to all the descendants, not just us. But that’s not really how we learn biology early on, isn’t? We learn plants and bacteria are primitive things, fish give rise to amphibians, followed by reptiles and mammals, then, you get you, this perfectly evolved creature at the end of the line. The life doesn’t evolve in a line and it doesn’t end with us. But we’re always shown evolution portraits something like this. From monkeys into chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward in steady march to becoming us. But they don’t become us any more then we would become them. We also not the goal of evolution. But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand evolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution has led to many problems, but you can’t ask that question, that age-old question that, where are we from, without understanding evolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has let to many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should tread other life on the earth and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So, let’s go back, 4 billion years. This is the single-cell organism we all came from. At first, it give rise to other single-cell of life. But these are still evolving to this day. and some would say the Archaea and bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going to be here well after us. About three billion years ago, multicellularity evolved. This includes fungi, plants, and animals. The first animals to develop a backbone were fishes. So, technically, all vertebrates are fishes. So, technically, you and I are fish. So, don’t said I didn’t warn you. One fish lineage came into the land and give rise to among other things, the mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds, some mammals become primates. Some primates become monkeys with tail, And others become the great apes, including variety of human species. So, you see, we didn’t evolve from monkeys, but we do share a common ancestor. All the whole, life around us kept evolving. More bacteria, more fungi, lots of fish, fish, fish, if you couldn’t tell, yes, they’re my favorite group. As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last for a few million years. So, you see most life on earth that we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So, is hubris, is self-centered to think, Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive. And we’ve been here for an evolutionary minute, so we are somehow special. Think of life as being this book, and unfinished book for sure. We are just seeing the last few pages of each chapter. If you look out on the 8 million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being 4 billion years of evolution. They are all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life. All of us are connected by invisible branches, not just to each other, but to our extincted relatives, and our evolutionary ancestors.

Cells respond to DNA damage by activating complex signalling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA repair and survival but also cell death. The decision between cell survival and death following DNA damage rests on factors that are involved in DNA damage recognition, and DNA repair and damage tolerance, as well as on factors involved in the activation of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and senescence. The pathways that dictate cell fate are entwined and have key roles in cancer initiation and progression. Furthermore, they determine the outcome of cancer therapy with genotoxic drugs. Understanding the molecular basis of these pathways is important not only for gaining insight into carcinogenesis, but also in promoting successful cancer therapy. In this Review, we describe key decision-making nodes in the complex interplay between cell survival and death following DNA damage. © Wynand P. Roos; 2016 In the event of DNA damage, cells activate DNA repair pathways to facilitate the removal of replication barriers. Conversely, in instances of irreparable DNA damage, cells are prompted to undergo programmed cell death[1]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of regular cellular metabolism, along with various environmental and endogenous genotoxic factors, pose a threat to the stability of DNA and other macromolecules[2]. In response to oxidative DNA damage, cells activate cell cycle checkpoints, leading to the arrest of the cell cycle and cessation of DNA replication. This creates a time window during which DNA repair pathways, such as excision repair, can effectively identify and repair DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. Excision repair is a critical system for repairing oxidative stress-induced DNA damage[3]. © Wynand P. Roos; 2016 Key damage tolerance mechanisms for cell survival[4][5][6]: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) homologous recombination (HR), MMR, BER, nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein-linked DNA break (PDB) repair in combination with DDR signallin. Three immediate-early sensors in the DDR - PI3K-related kinases (PIKKs)[7]: ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) ATM is frequently mutated in tumours[8], which is accompanied by a gain of therapeutic resistance[9]. ATM mutation increased risk of breast cancer[10] nad colon cancer[11] more frequently altered than ATR[12] ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) functionally compromised ATR also show malignancy DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) ATM and ATR promote cell death in instances of high DSB levels[13] © Wynand P.

Abstract Grade level BSFL replacements for protein from fishmeal were fed. replacement from 7%, 14%, 21%, 28%, to 36% (100% replacement to fishmeal) growth performance could be maintain when replacement ratio &lt; 25% Results To begin with, the author talked about the difference between BSFL and FM. Which could responsible for the different growth performance. On the other hand, it explained an appropriate replacement could maintain the shrimp growth. Discussion The survival ratio was not affected by the replacement. To consider the bodyweight gain, replacement &lt;20% is appropriate. To consider the protein and lipid composition, replacement &lt;7% is reasonable. Chia … maybe not affect palatability since shrimp can digest it appropriately. The author also talked about the feeding environment of the shrimp with they didn’t take the experiment and have no data. PS In this paper, the author finished the experiment of replacing FM with the BSFL and the data shows that it does not affect the survival ratio. However, with the increase of replacement, the BWG, protein, and lipid composition was affected. In the discussion part, the author re-informed that the BSFL was different from the FM. The ratio of EAA/NEAA may be responsible for the relatively poor growth performance in higher ratio replacement diets. Though there are no experiments and data from the Chia and Culture environment(Green water VSFresh water), the other discussed them that they may not be important and have very limited effects on this experiment. © iStock Black Soldier Fly Full-Fat Larvae Meal as an Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil in Siberian Sturgeon Nutrition: The Effects on Physical Properties of the Feed, Animal Growth Performance, and Feed Acceptance and Utilization cite: Rawski, Mateusz, et al. “Black Soldier Fly Full-Fat Larvae Meal as an Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil in Siberian Sturgeon Nutrition: The Effects on Physical Properties of the Feed, Animal Growth Performance, and Feed Acceptance and Utilization.” Animals 10.11 (2020): 2119. Summary: The replacement was up to 30%. feed Acceptance was increased by 10% and a higher replacement ratio no effects on feed digestibility Introduction 1. The population of the sturgeon decreased dramatically during the second half of the 20th century. 2. The plant protein-based diet is the main substitute for fish protein for carnivores. But sturgeons are highly sensitive to phytoestrogens. 3. Insects are one of the main foods for juvenile sturgeons 4. Defatting may decrease nutrition, for instance, AA and antimicrobial protein, in insect meal. Results As it shows in the Summary Discussion 1. compared the BSFL ingredient with other researches. 2. Talked about how the non-protein resources of N could affect the crude protein conversion factor. 3. Mineral balance of the diet. 4. Physical properties of BSFL food pellets. 5. The palatability of the BSFL meal: fatty, chitin, and free amino acids. 6. Chitin shows antiviral activity and stimulates immune system ability. But it also reduces palatability, digestibility coefficients, and growth performance. PS One marvelous thing is this research selected a fish that consume insects as the main food in juvenile age. So, they supposed the replacement diet has more beneficial effects than disadvantages on sturgeons. And it is. Besides, research was also focusing on how BSFL changes the physical properties of the feeding pellets which was rarely discussed among other papers. It also connected the physical properties to the palatability and digestibility coefficients of the pellets, though they have no data from this experiment. After that, they talked about the chitin, which has positive effects on fish when the concentration ratio is appropriate. However, this experiment shows that sturgeon could take all of advantages from chitin because not only the full-fatty BSFL has less chitin, but also sturgeon are highly adaptive to chitin diets in nature. © indiamart.com Development of black soldier fly larvae production technique as an alternate fish feed cite: Rana, KM Shakil, et al. “Development of black soldier fly larvae production technique as an alternate fish feed.” International Journal of Research in Fisheries and Aquaculture 5.1 (2015): 41-47. Abstract They tried a few diets for BSF feeding. And then feeding the fish with BSFL diet by the replacing ratio of T1(0%), T1(25%), T3(50%), and T4(100%). The growth performance of monosex tilapiawas T3 &gt; T2 &gt; T1 ≈ T4. PS This research has two main parts. The first part is about rearing the BSF with different diets which I’d like to ignore. The second part is treating tilapia with gradient BSFL diets. They compared other few BSFL substitute diets kinds of research in discussion and concluded that they had a similar result: replacement ratio is up to 50%… Yeap, that’s all. Let’s move on! Result 1. No significant growth performance, appetite, feed intake, conversion ratio, feed efficiency, or total digestibility were performed. A significant increase in apparent protein digestibility was observed. 2. Blood components have no significant differences. 3. Skin mucus immune response shows immune activity was boosted.

Steroid Hormones Homeostasis Regulation by the Liver Cholesterol Cholesterol Genesis(15) de-novo production hydrolysis of stored cholesterol interiorization of plasma membrane cholesterol from LDL and HDL Metabolism Metabolism(16, 17) 5αR1 (liver enzyme 5α-reductase 1) 5αR1-KO mice exhibited augmented mRNA levels of various hepatic metabolic regulators genes (e.g., Acc1, Agpat2, Cpt2, and Dgat2) in comparison to WT mice(18). CYP (cytochromes P450 enzymes) metabolism of many drugs and lipophilic compounds(19) CYP3A4, CYP19, CYP2C2B1, and CYP2C11 are the liver CYPs and take part in steroid hormones hydroxylation and processing CYP3A4(20,21) hydroxylases several steroids such as cortisol, androstenedione, testosterone, and progesterone CYP19 (Aromatase)(10) transforms androgens to estrogens by the removal of C19 carbon and the aromatization of the steroid A ring. CYP2C11 and CYP2B1(10) regulate hydroxylation of testosterone Nuclear receptors complexes NRC such as PXR, VDR, RXR were also found to bind CYP3A4 chromatin and affect its expression (23, 24) Steroids Conjunction exerted by such as sulfotransferare and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) ransfer the steroid hormones into higher polarity metabolites that are better suited to be excreted from the body(10). The sulfotransferases that are expressed by hepatic cells and are related to steroids conjugations are HSST, EST, SULT 2A1, and SULT 1E1 (25). be regulated by androgens, GCs, and nuclear receptors such as PXR(27). sulfotransferase inhibition as well as EST KO, led to the acceleration of free steroids and thus to sexual abnormalities (10,26).

Transportation As steroids, these hormones are lipophilic thus, when secreted into the blood stream they need to be bound to carrier proteins SHBG (Sex hormone binding globulin) CBG (Corticosteroid binding globulin) This carriers are glycoproteins which are mainly secreted by liver.(30, 31). Carrier proteins bind steroids and turn them to be biologically inactive (32). effect different molecular pathways and signaling such as apoptosis (33, 34) Regulation: factors such as glucose (35), thyroid hormone &lt; id=&quot;b_p18&quot;sup&gt;(36), and other factors such as the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α) (37), PPAR-γ (38), and p53 (14).

Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms is lack. P2: Problems caused by Cu exposure are too complicate to be explained by few regulatory entities, as a result, a whole gene expression profiling is need. P3: Though, previous studies find that lipid deposition and metabolic activity were changed,they focus on few genes only. Now, it is the first time for people profiling the RNA-Seq of this species.

(PS: you may think this things was mentioned before. Yes, it is, But here, the author made a comparing with other species. So, it is ok to recite them again) COG is useful, GO is useful, KEGG is useful. (PS: What the hex??? Probably is because this paper was published in 2015. So, it might be done at 2014 or even earlier.) Differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism General background information and cited a bunch of recent study(PS: his study). But the RNA-Seq is absent. So, this experiment is useful and meaningful.(PS: Again, recite the lyrics from the Abstract and Introduction) It provide the evidences of mitochondrial damage and inhibition of B-oxidation. (PS: Gosh, finally, we see something new. And end of this section.) Differentially expressed genes involved in immune system BG information of immune system and the benifitial of the RNA-Seq. (PS: Suggest to ignore) Interested Pathways and their BG infor. Filled with a list of DEGs, and compared few of them with other studies. suggest that immune reaction were involved in Cu-induced stress. Differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis BG infor for Apoptosis and CASP3. Calpain up-regulated; caspase-3 down-regulated, this was support in other two reports. (PS: They spend 236 words to interpret five words: Calpain up-regulated; caspase-3 down-regulate) Differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction BG: for MAPK pathway. Evidences from other papers. Here: c-fos involved in this pathway. Cu could induce ROS to active MAPK to elevate the phosphorylation. (PS: No ending sentence for this paragraph. The last sentence is lack of coherent.) (P2) BG: NFkB is an important redox-sensitive TF for immune-response. Here: NFkB down-regulated. But, there have no consensus on it. So, more experiments are needee. (PS: This paragraph is mach readable than few previous) BG: important of Ca2+ and Cu2+ can effect Ca2+ Here: Cu down-regulated genes in the calcium signaling pathway. The understanding of this process is helpful. Conclusion: This experiment is unique and this experiment has lots of potential contributions… PS: Finally, I finished this paper. Personally, I’m not suggesting anyone to read this paper really much. Because it is a kind of wasting time if you want to learn how to writing from this passage. You can perceive that too much of non-sense words are filled for words-accumulating. And some sentences are lack of coherent. But, of course, it could be a good counter example because it is not the worst, it’s still a readable paper, it’s just not a good model. And I just don’t like it.

Abstract M &amp; E are two widely used fish anesthetics. This experiment reveals the transcriptomic changing during the recovering from fish anesthetics (6h after treated). RNA from gills and livers were extracted and compared. Non essential data filled here. Some DEGs participated in human disease and metabolism.(ps: ummmm…WHAT? = =) Two treatment interested different pathways. MS-222 may affect metabolism and immunity and more harmful than eugenol. PS: Abstract briefly introduced the purpose &amp; results of the experiment. First, it revealed the toxicity of two anesthetics, and second, it can improve our understanding on some human diseases(maybe??) and the detoxification of the fish in the transcription level. Introduction P1: What is anesthetics; The contribution of anesthetics; Which anesthetics are available; How do them work; P2: Wide geography-distribution(It’s an important commercial species). Anesthetic could reduce the mortality during transportation. P3: Some related experiments had done but not on the same page. So, with the evidences of this experiment, people can make a better choice between MS-222 and eugenol.

MS-222 group: higher levels of AST, ALT, AKP, which reveals MS-222 cause more damages to livers.(explain: can not be metabolized) GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) BG: low activity of GST means low detoxification ability. Different responses of facing MS-222 in different species from previous research. Our result: L. maculatus is more vulnerable. A smaller number of DEGs may reveals lees intervention of E compared with M. (PS: = = smaller…) Additionally, eugenol is natural and may easier to metabolized. (PS: … Good, I just learned another skill to fill more words on discussion section) P3 Stress &amp; Metabolism BG: liver glucose oxidation is enhanced. Amino acid evolved in gluconeogenesis during the stress responses. Those pathways are enriched in both groups. Recent start verified point 1. P4 Pathways involved in environmental information processing Jak-STAT signaling, PI3KAkt signaling, TNF signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. BG: HPI-&gt;Cotisol; stress can inhibit inflammatory cytokine production and induce apoptosis, proliferation, and phagocytosis of immune cells. Here: More DEGs related immune-related pathways are found in E group. BG: stress affects HPG and may affect reprodctive performance; Here: Some DEGs involved in productive activities are found in M group. BG: Lethimonier observed that stress-induced cortisol inhibited vitellogenesis, Here: We found it here, too. Conclusion: MS-222 is more harmful than eugenol. P5 Gill &amp; Livers Result: not change the original functions of the organs P6 Conclusion MS-222 revealed that all these anesthetics regulate the metabolic and immune pathways in the fish, and MS-222 may trigger more damages on the fish liver and reproduction.

P6 Cholesterol Biosynthesis genes, rate-controlling enzyme ware up-regulated. Increasing the synthesis of cholesterol to matain the homeostasis. P7 Growth Performance Reduced cholesterol levels can cause a reduction in growth Support cholesterol to improving growth. cholesterol synthesis is a high energy expenditure. Compounds are highly involved in fatty acid P8 lipid Gene involved in lipid metabolism and transport were up-regulated. This change is involved in cholesterol homeostasis. The change happens in intestine as well as livers compared with previous experiment. P9 Over Overall Despite the changes, the total body lipid doesn’t have a significantly different after 61 days of feeding. So as the cholesterol. Increased cholesterol biosynthesis is compensated the lower diet intake. This result is different from a study done in rainbow trout. Plasma cholesterol content reduces in European seabass and Atlantic salmon with SPM feeding. Explain: excess cholesterol in the body is stored Conclusion Though, total weight and lipid are not significantly changed between two groups is because some how the fish compensated the different, like de novo cholesterol.

BMC Genomics 13:363 PS I think that the author did a good job on the discussion secession. First of all, he mad a conclusion about the Growth performance of the corps. This is what what we can see at the first glance, and one of the direct purpose of this experiment. On the other hand, the author gave a general summery of the different in metabolic, digestives, and cell signals change, etc. After that, the author focused on two widely concerned challenges in plant meals: lacking of some essential amino acids and lipid deficiency. As a result, the body protein deposition was definitely affected and oat was involved in Nitrogen compensate. About the Lipid metabolism, they found that the gene hmdh are respond to keep cholesterol homeostasis. After this discussion, the author are focused in talking about the interaction of the diet and genotype, the part makes this experiment unique. Above of, this discussion is a good example to show how to handle a discussion, how to write a story logically and neatly.

Youtube Link Author:Domain of Science Quantum Physics has been mythically complicate and hard to understand. In fact, Richard Feynmann who won the Nobel Prise for his work on quantum electron dynamic said, “If you think you understand quantum physics, you don’t understand quantum physics.” Which is kind of disheartening for us, because if he didn’t understand it, what chance that reset of us have? Fortunately, this quota is a little bit misleading. We do effect understand Quantum Physics really well. In fact, is arguably the most successful scientific theory out there. And that let us invent technologies like computers, digital cameras, LED screens, lasers, nuclear power plants. You know you don’t really want to build a nuclear power plant if you don’t really understand how it works. So, Quantum Physics is just a part of physics that describe very small of things in our Universe, molecules, atoms, subatomic particles things like that. That thing don’t down quiet work the same way that we used to up here. This is fascinating, because you and everything around you are made from Quantum Physics. And so, this is really hall of whole universe is actually working. As drawing this protons, neutrons, and electrons as particles, but in Quantum Mechanics, we really describe everything as waves. By the way, I am using the Quantum Physics and Quantum Mechanics inter-change be that is the same thing. So, instead an electron looking like this (a dot), it should look something like this(a wave). This is called a Wavefunction. But this wavefunction isn’t a real physical wave like a wave on water or sound-wave. The Quantum Wave is an abstract mathematical description. To get the real word properties like positional and momentums of an electron, we have to do mathematical operations on this wavefunction. So, for the position, we take the amplitude and square it, which for this wave will looks something like this. This gives us things called probability distribution. Which tells us that your are more like to find electron here than here. And when we actually measure where the electron is, an electron Popsicle pops up somewhere in this area. So, in Quantum Physics, we don’t know anything with infinite details, could only predict the probabilities of that things happen. And it looks like the fundamental feature of the universe, which is quiet deparcher from the clock work to determines of university in classical physics, the kind of thing Newton derived. This way function model predicts what subatomic particles will do is incredibly well. But wirely, we have got no idea of this wavefunction is literately real or not. No ones ever seen a quantum waves because whenever we measure an electron, all we have seen is a point like electron particle. So, there’s like there is a hide quantum realm where the wave is exist, and then, the word we can sem, which is all the waves turned into particles. And a barrier between this is measurement. We say that the measurement collapse it’s wavefunction. But we don’t actually have any physics to describe how the wave collapses. This is a gap on knowledge that we’ve doubt the measurement problems, and this is one of the things that Feynmann was referring to with this quote. Another confusing things is how exactly picture an electron. It seems to be a wave until you measure it, and then, it is a particle. So, what actually is it? It’s know as particle-wave duality and here is an example for action for Feynmann’s famous double slit experiment. Imaging spring a paper gun, into a wall with two opening in it. It is inspect to see two columns of pint go through and hit the wall behind. But if you shrink this all dots into electrons, you seen something quite different. You can fire one electrons at a time out the slits, and they appear on the back wall. But as they build up over time, you get a whole pattern of stripes instead of just two bands. This pattern of stripes was called interference pattern. Some thing you only seem with waves. The idea is that it’s electron wave that goes through both slits at the same time, and then the waves from each slit overlap with each other. In where the waves get together, you get high probability of electron popping up in the wall. But where the waves comes rare the probabilities are very low. So, actually on the back wall, the highest probability of you find the electron is in the middle of the slits. And then it goes down, and up and and up-down again. This is the interference pattern. So, if you fire one electron after another, they follow this probabilities distribution, and this interference pattern start building up and thats exactly what we see in the experiment. So, this shows that electrons behave like waves in this experiment. The question is what actually happens to this spread out electron wave when you do measurement. Seems like you go through this spread out wave to this look like particle. But like I said, this is nothing in Quantum Mechanics that tell us how the wavefunction collapses. And this is not the only true for electrons. That everything in the universe. So, this double slits experiments has huge consequence from modeling universe. And it’s very surprising the first time when it was down. Physicists are still grapling with this question today and come up with many interpretations of quantum mechanics and trying to explain this results, and explaining, how reality actually works. Ok, let’s go back to the wavefunction, we can now use this picture to explain other feature of Quantum Physics that you may have heard about. So, this is just one possible wave function for electron. But there have many others. Like this one for instance. This says it as an electron has probabilities have been here and probabilities over been here. And very little probability have been in the middle. This is perfectly allowed in Quantum Physics. And this wither Frams thinks can be two place in once comes from. This is know as superposition, which comes from the fact that this wave made by adding or super-imposing this two waves. The word superposition just means the adding together of the waves. We already saw this in double slit experiment. And It’s not really a very special phenomenon. You can even seen superposition by draping two paddles into a pond to see the repels overlap. Now for entanglement.

Fortunately_ this quote is a little misleading. We do in e that reset of us have? Fortunately, this quota is a little bit misleading. We do ef fact understand quantum physics really well, in fact it is arguably the most successful fect understand Quantum Physics really well. In fact, is arguably the most successful scientific theory out there, and has let us invent technologies like computers, digita scientific theory out there. And that let us invent technologies like computers, digita l cameras, LED screens, lasers and nuclear power plants. And you know, you don’t really l cameras, LED screens, lasers, nuclear power plants. You know you don't really want to build a nuclear power plant if you don’t really understand how it works. So qua want to build a nuclear power plant if you don’t really understand how it works. So, Qua ntum physics is the part of physics that describes the smallest things in our Unive ntum Physics is just a part of physics that describe very small of things in our Unive rse: molecules, atoms, subatomic particles thing like that. Th_____ings down there do_n rse, molecules, atoms, subatomic particles things like that. That thing don‘t down ’t qui_te work the same way that we are used to up here. This is fascinating_ because yo quiet work the same way that we used to up here. This is fascinating, because yo u and everything around you is made from quantum physics, and so_ this is really how_ t u and everything around you are made from Quantum Physics. And so, this is really hall o he whole universe is actually working. I’ve draw_n_ these protons, neutrons_ and electro f whole universe is actually working. As drawing this protons, neutrons, and electro ns as particles, but in quantum mechanics_ we really describe everything as waves. By th ns as particles, but in Quantum Mechanics, we really describe everything as waves. By th e way_ I’m using q____uantum physics and quantum mechanics inter_changeably, they are t e way, I am using the Quantum Physics and Quantum Mechanics inter-change be that is t he same thing. So_ instead of an electron looking like this________, it should look some he same thing. So, instead an electron looking like this (a dot), it should look some thing like this________. This is called a wave-function. But this wave-function isn’t a thing like this(a wave). This is called a Wavefunction. But this wavefunction isn't a real physical wave like wave on water or a sounds wave. A quantum wave is an abstrac real physical wave like a wave on water or sound-wave. The Quantum Wave is an abstrac t mathematical description. To get the real world properties like position__ or_ momentu t mathematical description. To get the real word properties like positional and momentu m of an electron_ we have to do mathematical operations on this wave-function, so_ for ms of an electron, we have to do mathematical operations on this wavefunction. So, for the position we take the amplitude and square it, which for this wave would look_ somet the position, we take the amplitude and square it, which for this wave will looks somet hing like this. This gives us a thing called a probability distribution_ which tells us hing like this. This gives us things called probability distribution. Which tells us that you_ are more likely to find the electron here than here, and when we actually mea that your are more like to find electron here than here. And when we actually mea sure where the electron is, an electron particle pops up somewhere within this area. S sure where the electron is, an electron Popsicle pops up somewhere in this area. S o_ with quantum physics_ we don’t know anything with infinite detail_, we can only pre o, in Quantum Physics, we don’t know anything with infinite details, could only pre dict probabilities that things will happen, and it looks like this is a fundament dict the probabilities of that things happen. And it looks like the fundament al feature of the Universe which was quite a departu_re from the clock_work,__ determin al feature of the universe, which is quiet deparcher from the clock work to determin istic universe__ in classical physics, the kind of thing Newton derived. This wave-funct es of university in classical physics, the kind of thing Newton derived. This way funct ion model predicts what subatomic particles will do i___ncredibly well, but weirdly we’ ion model predicts what subatomic particles will do is incredibly well. But wirely, we __ve got no idea if this wave-function is literal_ly real or not. No one has ever seen a have got no idea of this wavefunction is literately real or not. No ones ever seen a quantum wave because whenever we measure an electron_ all we e_ver see_ is a point lik quantum waves because whenever we measure an electron, all we have seen is a point lik e electron particle. So there is like th____is hidden quantum realm where the wave__s e electron particle. So, there's like there is a hide quantum realm where the wave is exist, and then the world we can see, which is where all the waves have turned into pa exist, and then, the word we can sem, which is all the waves turned into pa rticles. And the barrier between these is a measurement. We say a measurement ‘co rticles. And a barrier between this is measurement. We say that the measurement co llapses’ the wave function, but we don’t actually have any physics to describe how the llapse it's wavefunction. But we don‘t actually have any physics to describe how the wave collapses. This is a gap in our knowledge that we have d_ubbed the measurement prob wave collapses. This is a gap on knowledge that we’ve doubt the measurement prob lem_, and this is one of the things that Feynmann was referring to with his quote. Anot lems, and this is one of the things that Feynmann was referring to with this quote. Anot her confusing thing is how exactly to picture an electron. It seems to be a wave until her confusing things is how exactly picture an electron. It seems to be a wave until you measure it, and then it is a particle, so_ what actually is it? This is known as pa you measure it, and then, it is a particle. So, what actually is it? It's know as pa rticle-wave duality, and here is an example of it in action: the________ famous doubl rticle-wave duality and here is an example for action for Feynmann's famous doubl e slit experiment. Imagine spraying a paintball gun a_t_ a wall with two openings in it e slit experiment. Imaging spring a paper gun, into a wall with two opening in it , you’d ex_pect to see two columns of paint go through and hit the wall behind. But if y . It is inspect to see two columns of pint go through and hit the wall behind. But if y ou shrink this all down to the size of electrons_ you see_ something quite different. Yo ou shrink this all dots into electrons, you seen something quite different. Yo u can fire one electron_ at a time a_t the slits_ and they appear on the back wall, but u can fire one electrons at a time out the slits, and they appear on the back wall. But as they build up over time_ you get a whole pattern of stripes, instead of just two band as they build up over time, you get a whole pattern of stripes instead of just two band s, this pattern of stripes i_s called an interference pattern, some_thing you only see s. This pattern of stripes was called interference pattern. Some thing you only seem with waves. The idea is that it is the electron-wave that goes through both slits at the with waves. The idea is that it's electron wave that goes through both slits at the same time, and then the waves from each slit overlap with each other, and where the wav same time, and then the waves from each slit overlap with each other. In where the wav es add together you have a high probability of the electron popping up at the wall, but es get together, you get high probability of electron popping up in the wall. But where the waves cancel out the probability i_s very low. So actually on the back where the waves comes rare the probabilities are very low. So, actually on the back wall_ the highest probability of finding the electron is in the middle of the slits, wall, the highest probability of you find the electron is in the middle of the slits. and then it goes down and up again, and down and up again and this is the interfere And then it goes down, and up and and up-down again. This is the interfere nce pattern. So_ when you fire one electron after another_ they follow this probability_ nce pattern. So, if you fire one electron after another, they follow this probabilitie _ distribution_ and this interference pattern starts building up, and that’s exactly wha s distribution, and this interference pattern start building up and thats exactly wha t we see in _e__xperiments. So this shows that electrons behave like waves in this exp t we see in the experiment. So, this shows that electrons behave like waves in this exp eriment. A__ question is what actually happens to this spread-out electron-wave when you eriment. The question is what actually happens to this spread out electron wave when you do a measurement? It seems like it_ goes f_rom__ this spread out wave to this loca_lise do measurement. Seems like you go through this spread out wave to this look like d particle, but like I said, there’s nothing in quantum mechanics that tells us how the particle. But like I said, this is nothing in Quantum Mechanics that tell us how the wave-function collapses. And this is not only true for electrons, bu_t for everythin wavefunction collapses. And this is not the only true for electrons. That everythin g in the Universe, so_ this double slit_ experiment_ has huge consequences for our model g in the universe. So, this double slits experiments has huge consequence from model of the Universe, and it was very surprising the first time it was do_ne. Physicist ing universe. And it's very surprising the first time when it was down. Physicist s are still grappling with this question today and have come up with many interpretation s are still grapling with this question today and come up with many interpretation s of quantum mechanics to try an explain these results, and explain____ how reality s of quantum mechanics and trying to explain this results, and explaining, how reality actually works. Okay let_s go back to the wave-function. Now we can use this picture actually works. Ok, let's go back to the wavefunction, we can now use this picture to explain other features of quantum physics that you may have heard about. So this is to explain other feature of Quantum Physics that you may have heard about. So, this is just one possible wave-function for an electron, but there are many others. Like this just one possible wave function for _electron. But there have many others. Like this one for instance. This says that the electron has a probability of_ being over here, one for instance. This says it as an electron has probabilities have been here and a probability__ of__ being over here, and very little probability of__ being in the and probabilities over been here. And very little probability have been in the middle. This is perfectly allowable in quantum physics_ and this is where the phra_se middle. This is perfectly allowed in Quantum Physics. And this wither Frams ‘things can be in two places at once’ comes from. This is known as superposition, which thinks can be two place in once comes from.

This shared process highlights the similarities in fundamental biochemical pathways across diverse species. When compare to E. coli to human cell, E.coli are way more complicated than human cell: all amino acid: It can synthesize all amino acids, whereas humans can’t produce all of them endogenously. Food: Capable of consuming more than 100 types of food. Environments: Can thrive in a wide range of environments, showcasing its adaptability. In contrast, human cells seem more like simplified microbes. The evolution might have played a role in streamlining certain processes in eukaryotes. Ribosomes in Chemistry It precisely matches the protein shelves, making it extremely conservative in its function. Secondary structures are paramount, leading to mutations that are commonly paired to preserve structure and function. Due to the matched protein structure, the rate of gene drift is limited, ensuring stability. Research on this ribosome led to the discovery of Archaea, prompting a revision in our understanding of the tree of life. Gene Transfer Among Microbes Gene transfer, often referred to as Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), is a prevalent phenomenon among microbes. The mechanisms include: Uptake of free DNA from the environment. Plasmid-mediated transfer. Conjugative mating. Virus-mediated transfer (transduction). However, HGT is less common in Eukaryotes, with a few exceptions. Operon: A Unique Feature of Microbes Microbes often have related functional genes located in proximity. This arrangement is no accident. These genes are regulated by operons, ensuring they function in sync. The clustering of these genes is believed to have arisen due to evolutionary pressures and random events, but once established, they provide a selective advantage. © Peter Karp, 2007 pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/08/21/LearnNotes/UIUC-AdBC-1/"},{"title":"Advanced Molecular &amp; Cell Biology 1","text":"DNA Structure; RNA Polymerase Properties; $\\sigma$ Factor 70 !!! Main purpose for this lecture DNA sequences drive specific Protein:DNA interactions, which is fundamental for processes like transcription. Transcription steps can be experimentally defined, allowing for detailed understanding and manipulation. General Properties Response Element Recognition: Response elements are DNA sequences that are recognized and bound by transcription factors, enabling regulation of gene expression. HAT/PTM Complexes: Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and post-translational modifications (PTM) play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression by modifying histones and other proteins. Chromatin Remodeling: This process allows for accessibility of transcriptional machinery to the DNA by changing the structure of chromatin. Mediator: A complex that acts as an interface between transcriptional activators, RNA polymerase, and other transcriptional machinery.

Closed Promoter Complex Formation: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region without unwinding the DNA double helix. Open Promoter Complex Formation: The DNA double helix unwinds, allowing RNA polymerase to initiate RNA synthesis. $\\sigma$ Factors Driving Specificity/Stability Background: Core enzyme indiscriminate about the T4 genes it transcribes, it also transcribes both DNA strands. Experiment: RNA made by the holoenzyme did not hybridize with authentic T4 RNA, confirming it is made asymmetrically like the in vivo RNA. About 30% of the RNA made by the core enzyme hybridized with authentic T4 RNA and became RNase-resistant. Conclusion: The core enzyme transcribes both DNA strands, unlike the holoenzyme that transcribes asymmetrically. This suggests the core enzyme’s activity is not as specific as the holoenzyme’s. $\\sigma$ factors are essential for promoter recognition and transcription initiation. They stabilize DNA-bound RNA Polymerase, ensuring efficient transcription. Filter Binding Assay: DNA molecules can pass through a filter, but the $\\sigma$ factor cannot. When mixed together, DNA molecules associate with the $\\sigma$ factor, preventing them from passing through. $\\sigma$ factor aligns RNA Polymerase at a promoter, ensuring accurate transcription initiation. Assay for Locating the ‘Melted’ DNA: Radio labeling is used to tag specific DNA sequences. Methylation of DNA occurs at specific sites. Cleavage of DNA at methylated sites provides insights into DNA regions that are “melted” or unwound during transcription. Technics Filter binding assay P108, Figure 5.35 Nitrocellulose Membrane Filters and DNA-Protein Interaction Background: Nitrocellulose membrane filters have long been used for filter-sterilizing solutions. They are also known to bind DNA, but under specific conditions. Key Points: Binding Conditions: Single-stranded DNA: Binds readily to nitrocellulose. Double-stranded DNA: Does not bind to nitrocellulose by itself. Protein: Binds to nitrocellulose. When bound to double-stranded DNA, the protein-DNA complex will bind to the filter. Assay Demonstrations: Figure 5.35a: Labeled double-stranded DNA passed through the filter shows that it does not bind to nitrocellulose. All labeled material found in the filtrate. Figure 5.35b: Labeled protein is filtered and is found to bind to the nitrocellulose filter. Demonstrates that proteins can bind independently. Figure 5.35c: Labeled double-stranded DNA mixed with a binding protein shows that the protein-DNA complex binds to the filter. The radioactivity is found bound to the filter, confirming the interaction. Conclusion: Filter binding assays using nitrocellulose membrane filters serve as a direct measure of DNA-protein interaction. This makes nitrocellulose filters a useful tool for studying such interactions. Methylation-S1 nuclease Figure 6.15; P133 Figure 6.16; P134 Background: In 1979, Ulrich Siebenlist carried out an experiment to identify the base pairs melted by RNA polymerase in a T7 phage early promoter. The aim was to understand the local DNA melting involved in the formation of an open promoter complex. Key Points: Experiment Strategy: Step 1: End-label the promoter DNA. Step 2: Add RNA polymerase to form an open promoter complex, which involves local DNA melting. Step 3: Methylate exposed adenines with dimethyl sulfate (DMS). Step 4: Remove RNA polymerase to allow the region to close. Step 5: Treat the DNA with S1 nuclease, which specifically cuts single-stranded DNA. Step 6: Electrophorese the labeled DNA fragments to determine their lengths. Chemical Agent Used: Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylates exposed adenines, preventing them from base-pairing with thymines in the opposite strand when the region closes. S1 Nuclease: Specifically cuts where an adenine had been in a melted region and had become methylated. Results: A series of fragments extending from position 13 to 29 were observed, rather than a neat set. The length of the melted region was estimated to be 12 base pairs. G–C pairs were not detected due to the experimental conditions used for methylation. Conclusion: The melted region in the T7 phage early promoter was identified to extend from positions 13 to 29 and to have a length of approximately 12 bp. This is in agreement with previous estimates. The experiment revealed that the melted region is precisely where RNA polymerase begins transcribing, which is of biological significance. However, the presence of G–C pairs in the region could not be verified due to limitations in the methylation conditions used. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/08/22/LearnNotes/UIUC-AdMC-1/"},{"title":"听抄3: If you Don&#39;t understand Quantum Physics, Try This!","text":"听抄3: If you Don’t understand Quantum Physics, Try This! Youtube Link Author:Domain of Science 6:02 Now, for entanglement. Let’s say, two electron waves meet. The eaves interfaced with each other become mixed up. This means that mathematically, we now have one wavefunction that describe everything about both electrons. And them, inextracablly linked, even if they move away far from each other. A measurement on one of the particle like measuring if it spans up and down, is correlated the measurement of the other. Even if they moved billions of miles away. Einstein feel very uncomfortable with this idea because if you measure one of the particles here, you instantly know what the other will be even it is billions of miles away. And that’s got a sort of wave faster than the light communication, which is not allowed by the theory of relativity. But it turns out that you can’t actually use this for communicate information because the measurements give you random results. But the fact that the correlated means that some how, there is a link that strach over that distance. This is called Non-locality. Quantum Tunnelling. Quantum Tunnelling is where particles of probabilities of moving through is a barriers essentially allowed things like electrons to pass through the walls. But the wavefunction meets the barrier, it decades exponentially inside the barrier. But, if the Barrier is now on other’s wavefunction still exist on the other side. Meaning that there are still probability of the particle been found there when the measurement is made. In fact the only reason in your are a life is because the Quantum Tunnelling in the sun which makes the sun shine. Protons randomly repair each other, but they got small probability of Quantum Tunnelling into each other, which was turns hydrogen into helium, and release it’s fusion energy. All life exist on earth because of the energy from the Sun except for life relied on hydro-thermalvents. Now, onto the Heisenberg Uncertain Principle. Instead at the beginning of that this wavefunction contains all the informations like the position, momentum of the electrons, we just have to do some maths on it. The position is given by amplitude and height of the wave. And the momentum given by the wavelength of the wave. By for this specific waves, the position gives probability distribution. So, we don’t know exactly where the electron is. Also, there is an uncertainty in the momentum because this wave is made of many different wavelength. But, we can’t predict that uncertainty. Let’s have a wave has only one wavelength. So, a sin-wave. Now, we know them momentum exactly, because the wavelength is a single valuer. But looking at position, there is equal probability of electron could be found anywhere in the universe. Ok, let’s do the opposite. Let’s make a wave has only one position. Now, we know where exactly the electron is. But what the wavelength of this wave? Now, the wavelength is very uncertain. Basically, only a sin-wave gives you a precise momentum. And any wave that isn’t a perfect sin-wave, you have to build out multiple perfect sin-waves. And each of those multiple different sin-waves got a different wavelength. And hence, you have a range of possible different values of momentum of the particle. This is Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You can only know somethings precisely but not everything. If you got a definite value of momentum, we don’t know anything about the position. Or you know the position very well, but don’t know anything about momentum. Or, you in some intermediate state. And this is a limits of our measurement operating. This is a fundamental property of the universe. And finally, where is the name Energy Quantization come from? Well, quantum is a packet of something, like a chunk of something. One of the first quantum effect people saw were atomic spectrum, which is where atoms give of light with specific dis-create of energies. It works like this. Imaging a string that tight both its end, like a guitar string. If you pluck only certain waves can exist because the ends of tight end. In this situation, we say this wavelength is quantised to certain values. The same happens if you tight the ends of the string together because the wave has to match up, they can only vibrating on a certain restricted waves. And this is what happening when two electron in an atom. The electron waves is constrained by the atom quantised into a certain wavelength. Short wavelength got high energy, and long wavelength got low energy. This is why the light emitted by an atom looked like a buck hold because this barrier of light correspond to a an electron jumping from a wave with high energy to one wiht low energy. And at the same time, it emitting a quantised of photon light when it dose with this. So, the light from an atom is a quantised to descreate packets of energy. Ok, so that’s all the basic of the quantum physics. Here is some technical notes which on essential to know, but the post in screen now is interested in a little bit more about the mathematical detail. So, to round up, in quantum physics, objects are described as wave function. But when we measure them, what we see are particles. This leads particles-wave duality, and also the measurement problem. In the consequence of this wavefunctions, a quantum phenomenon superposition entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and energy Quantization. So, if you understand of this things, you got a good basic understanding of quantum physics. Despite its reputation of quantum mechanics isn’t too difficult for most people to get to basic of what’s going on. Identity: 86.38% 5894 Now_ for entanglement. Let’s say_ two electron-waves meet.

Now on to the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle. I s__aid that the beginning _ lvents. Now, onto the Heisenberg Uncertain Principle. Instead at the beginning o that this wave-function contains all of the information like position and momentu f that this wavefunction contains all the informations like the position, momentu m of the electron, we just have to do some maths on it. The position is given by the am m of the electrons, we just have to do some maths on it. The position is given by am plitude, or_ height of the wave, and the momentum is given by the wavelength of the wave plitude and height of the wave. And the momentum given by the wavelength of the wave . But for this specific wave_ the position gives us a probability distribution, so_ we . By for this specific waves, the position gives probability distribution. So, we don’t know exactly where the electron is. Also_ there is an uncertainty in the momentum don’t know exactly where the electron is. Also, there is an uncertainty in the momentum because this wave is made of many different wavelengths. But_ we can__ reduce that unce because this wave is made of many different wavelength. But, we can‘t predict that unce rtainty, let’s have a wave that only has one wavelength, so_ a sine wave.

Okay let’s do the opposite let’s make a wave that has only got one position. N niverse. Ok, let’s do the opposite. Let's make a wave has only one position. N ow_ we know e____xactly where the electron is, but what is the wavelength of the wave ow, we know where exactly the electron is. But what the wavelength of this wave ? Now the wavelength is very uncertain. Basically_ only a sine wave gives you a precise ? Now, the wavelength is very uncertain. Basically, only a sin-wave gives you a precise momentum, and any wave that isn’t a perfect sine wave, you have to build out of multipl momentum. And any wave that isn’t a perfect sin-wave, you have to build out multipl e differ_ent sine waves, and each of those multiple different sine waves has got a diffe e perfect sin-waves. And each of those multiple different sin-waves got a diffe rent wavelength, and hence_ you have a range of possible different values of momentum fo rent wavelength. And hence, you have a range of possible different values of momentum o r the particle. This is Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle, you can only know c__ertain f the particle. This is Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You can only know somet things precisely, but not everything. Either you have got a definite value of momentum, hings precisely but not everything. If you got a definite value of momentum, and don’t know anything about position, or you know the position very well, but don’ we don’t know anything about the position.

If you pluck it, only certain waves can exist because the ends are tie a guitar string. If you pluck only certain waves can exist because the ends of tig d down,_ in this situation_ we say that the wavelengths are quantised to certain values ht end. In this situation, we say this wavelength is quantised to certain values . The same thing happens if you ties_ the ends of the string together because the waves . The same happens if you tight the ends of the string together because the wave have to match up, they can only vibrate__ in __certain restricted way_s. And this is wha has to match up, they can only vibrating on a certain restricted waves. And this is wha t is happening to__ an_ electron in an atom. The electron-wave_ is constrained by the at t happening when two electron in an atom. The electron waves is constrained by the at om and quantised __to _certain wavelengths, short wavelength have high energy and long om quantised into a certain wavelength. Short wavelength got high energy, and long wavelengths have a lower energy. This is why the light emitted by an atom looks like a wavelength got low energy. This is why the light emitted by an atom looked like a barc___o_de because each__ bar____ of light corresponds to a__n electron jumping from a buck hold because this barrier of light correspond to a an electron jumping from a wave with a high energy to one with a lower energy, and at the same time emitting a wave with high energy to one wiht low energy. And at the same time, it emitting a quantised photon of light when it do_es this. So_ the light from an atom is __qu quantised of photon light when it dose with this. So, the light from an atom is a qu antised to discre_te packets of energy. Okay so that’s all the basics of quantum ph antised to descreate packets of energy. Ok, so that's all the basic of the quantum ph ysics, here are some technical notes which aren’t essential to know, but pause the s ysics. Here is some technical notes which on essential to know, but the post in s creen now if you are interested in a little more mathematical detail. So creen now is interested in a little bit more about the mathematical detail. So, to round up. In quantum physics objects are described with wave-functions, but when we to round up, in quantum physics, objects are described as wave function. But when we measure them, what we see are particles, so this leads to particle-wave duality, and al measure them, what we see are particles. This leads particles-wave duality, and al so the measurement problem. And the consequence of these wave-functions are the quantum so the measurement problem. In the consequence of this wavefunctions, a quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg uncertaint phenomenon superposition entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg Uncertaint y principle_ and energy quantisation. So_ if you understand these things you have go y Principle, and energy Quantization. So, if you understand of this things, you go t a good basic understanding of quantum physics. Despite its reputation I think quantum t a good basic understanding of quantum physics.

00:00:10,417 Translator: Karobben 2 00:00:10,417 --&gt; 00:00:13,000 让我来告诉大家关于我妈的故事. 3 00:00:13,000 --&gt; 00:00:18,292 我妈在生我的时候, 已经42岁了, 4 00:00:18,292 --&gt; 00:00:23,300 之后,她开始了她人生的第一次锻炼 5 00:00:23,300 --&gt; 00:00:25,792 一开始, 她只是再街区之间跑步, 6 00:00:25,792 --&gt; 00:00:32,209 紧接着, 她开始了5千米项目, 然后再是10千米跑, 7 00:00:32,209 --&gt; 00:00:36,400 再之后,她开始了马拉松运动, 8 00:00:36,400 --&gt; 00:00:40,792 最后直接开始参加铁人三项 9 00:00:40,792 --&gt; 00:00:44,292 但到了这个时候,她已经57岁了. 10 00:00:44,292 --&gt; 00:00:51,050 我妈也徒步去过Everest的营地. 11 00:00:51,050 --&gt; 00:00:53,918 (哈哈哈) 12 00:00:53,918 --&gt; 00:00:56,300 接下来, 我想说说我爸爸. 13 00:00:56,300 --&gt; 00:01:00,792 (哈哈哈哈哈哈) 14 00:01:00,792 --&gt; 00:01:06,501 小时候, 我爸就经常带我去他的科学课上 15 00:01:06,501 --&gt; 00:01:12,400 同时, 他也是我高中的微积分学老师 16 00:01:12,400 --&gt; 00:01:13,600 (哈哈) 17 00:01:13,600 --&gt; 00:01:15,900 我当时简直想躲在课桌下面哭 18 00:01:15,900 --&gt; 00:01:17,700 (哈哈哈哈哈) 19 00:01:17,700 --&gt; 00:01:20,000 我从我妈那里学到了的重要的东西: 20 00:01:20,000 --&gt; 00:01:23,000 健康的重要 21 00:01:23,000 --&gt; 00:01:27,501 我从我爸那里学到了的重要的东西: 22 00:01:27,501 --&gt; 00:01:30,209 科学的重要. 23 00:01:30,209 --&gt; 00:01:35,876 这两个重要的观念, 为我人生的道路领航 24 00:01:35,876 --&gt; 00:01:40,300 这两个观念, 使我对我们所有人面对的&quot;流行性问题&quot;怀有感激. 25 00:01:40,300 --&gt; 00:01:43,501 这个流行性问题不是埃博拉 26 00:01:43,501 --&gt; 00:01:47,792 相反,我指的是, 流行性的不健康生活习惯. 27 00:01:47,792 --&gt; 00:01:52,584 全球有超过5亿的过胖人口 28 00:01:52,584 --&gt; 00:01:56,918 然后, 你们可能会想, 在美国Surgeon General 第一次发布烟草有害的50年后, 29 00:01:56,918 --&gt; 00:02:03,709 吸烟给我们带来的问题比预期还大. 30 00:02:03,709 --&gt; 00:02:09,292 现在, 全球有10已的烟民. 31 00:02:09,292 --&gt; 00:02:14,900 烟瘾和肥胖是两个最容易预防的 32 00:02:14,900 --&gt; 00:02:18,000 早逝诱因. 33 00:02:18,000 --&gt; 00:02:22,417 解决这些问题就像完成拼图一样. 34 00:02:22,417 --&gt; 00:02:25,792 我们之所以会有这些不健康的习惯,来源于我们的基因, 35 00:02:25,792 --&gt; 00:02:28,127 来源于我们大脑的神经递质, 36 00:02:28,127 --&gt; 00:02:33,000 来源于环境影响,比如同年人和媒体. 37 00:02:33,000 --&gt; 00:02:35,292 这里的任何一小块拼图, 38 00:02:35,292 --&gt; 00:02:40,918 单靠我们自己是无法解决的. 39 00:02:40,918 --&gt; 00:02:47,292 但是, 其中有一块拼图, 也许掌握了问题之关键所在 40 00:02:47,292 --&gt; 00:02:52,162 我们对回应对抽烟和过度饮食等 41 00:02:52,162 --&gt; 00:02:58,709 上瘾行为的渴望的选择 42 00:02:58,709 --&gt; 00:03:00,792 我们的选择 43 00:03:00,792 --&gt; 00:03:04,000 这里有一个关于自控力衍生的新学科 44 00:03:04,000 --&gt; 00:03:08,501 也许掌握了逆转流行性问题的关键 45 00:03:08,501 --&gt; 00:03:11,209 他的名字叫&quot;Willingness&quot; 46 00:03:11,209 --&gt; 00:03:16,209 Willingness 意味着, 让你的渴望产生与消失 47 00:03:16,209 --&gt; 00:03:22,083 同时, 并不用抽烟或者不健康饮食来回应 48 00:03:22,083 --&gt; 00:03:28,500 但,事实上, 我并不是来讨论意志力的, 我也不是来宣传 49 00:03:28,500 --&gt; 00:03:30,792 “通过渴望而获得力量” 50 00:03:30,792 --&gt; 00:03:34,918 相对的, 我是要提一个对于渴望的, 不同的观点 51 00:03:34,918 --&gt; 00:03:39,258 就像这个样子: 52 00:03:39,258 --&gt; 00:03:44,209 停止对渴望的反抗 53 00:03:44,209 --&gt; 00:03:50,100 放宽心, 让这些渴望,合理的存在 54 00:03:50,100 --&gt; 00:03:53,501 并且, 心平气和的对待他们 55 00:03:53,501 --&gt; 00:03:55,900 现在, 在这个时候, 你们也许会非常怀疑(我说的) 56 00:03:55,900 --&gt; 00:04:01,000 (哈哈) 57 00:04:01,000 --&gt; 00:04:05,083 当几年前, 我第一次听见这个的时候,我是(挺怀疑的) 58 00:04:05,083 --&gt; 00:04:08,667 那时候我一个朋友带着一本关于 &quot;Willingness&quot;的书跑过来 59 00:04:08,667 --&gt; 00:04:11,125 他对我说: &quot;Jonathan, 60 00:04:11,125 --&gt; 00:04:17,709 这本书会永远的改变你的一生!&quot; 61 00:04:17,709 --&gt; 00:04:24,000 然后我回答 “喔, 好… 嗯嗯… 嗯嗯, 我会看看的.” 62 00:04:24,000 --&gt; 00:04:29,400 所以,我浏览了一遍,然后想, “呐, 这就是一些, 心理絮语(心理疗法)” 63 00:04:29,400 --&gt; 00:04:31,709 然后我就把他丢在了一边. 64 00:04:31,709 --&gt; 00:04:34,083 直到几年以后当我老婆 65 00:04:34,083 --&gt; 00:04:39,200 带我去了华盛顿大学的一个 &quot;Willingness&quot;的研讨会 66 00:04:39,200 --&gt; 00:04:42,792 然后, 我被折服了. 67 00:04:42,792 --&gt; 00:04:44,501 所以, 我开始读起来一些书, 68 00:04:44,501 --&gt; 00:04:46,751 再接着, 我读了很多关于 &quot;Willingness&quot;的书. 69 00:04:46,751 --&gt; 00:04:48,792 并且, 我接受了相关的训练 70 00:04:48,792 --&gt; 00:04:53,083 之后, 我从中学到了. “Willingness&quot;是&quot;接受与肯定疗法” 71 00:04:53,083 --&gt; 00:04:57,400 中的以改变行为为目而去接受的一部分. 72 00:04:57,400 --&gt; 00:04:59,417 它拓宽了改变行为的方法 73 00:04:59,417 --&gt; 00:05:04,209 这个已经被运用于帮助焦虑症人群,上瘾人群 74 00:05:04,209 --&gt; 00:05:05,919 甚至有些创新的公司 75 00:05:05,919 --&gt; 00:05:09,086 用这个来帮助员工提高业绩 76 00:05:09,086 --&gt; 00:05:11,501 并且减轻他们的压力. 77 00:05:11,501 --&gt; 00:05:14,417 现在, 想要知道, 我为什么被它惊讶到了 78 00:05:14,417 --&gt; 00:05:18,292 首先你们得知道, 我的环境. 79 00:05:18,292 --&gt; 00:05:20,209 在我的研究领域, 80 00:05:20,209 --&gt; 00:05:23,918 一个最常用的帮助人们戒烟,减肥的方法 81 00:05:23,918 --&gt; 00:05:27,292 是教他们避免产生这种渴望. 82 00:05:27,292 --&gt; 00:05:32,709 不要产生吸烟的想法,分散你对食物的渴望. 83 00:05:32,709 --&gt; 00:05:37,417 有一首来之百老汇的歌曲完美的描绘了这个疗法. 84 00:05:37,417 --&gt; 00:05:40,000 他是这样唱到: 85 00:05:40,000 --&gt; 00:05:45,000 (旋律) 当你被你脑中的想法所困惑的时候 86 00:05:45,000 --&gt; 00:05:47,881 不要去想这些东西了 87 00:05:47,881 --&gt; 00:05:53,292 快停下来 88 00:05:53,292 --&gt; 00:05:58,300 像灯的开关一样把他关掉就像我们 89 00:05:58,300 --&gt; 00:05:59,593 平常关灯一样,随手关掉它 90 00:05:59,593 --&gt; 00:06:02,876 当你感到有些想法不对的时候. 91 00:06:02,876 --&gt; 00:06:08,200 把这些讨厌的感觉当成床头灯一样关掉它们. 92 00:06:08,200 --&gt; 00:06:10,292 (2333) 93 00:06:10,292 --&gt; 00:06:15,709 (piapiapia) 94 00:06:15,709 --&gt; 00:06:18,292 我们都生活在这样一个环境中, 95 00:06:18,292 --&gt; 00:06:24,000 这里的歌曲不停的灌输着 “关闭这些不好的感觉.” 96 00:06:24,000 --&gt; 00:06:28,584 那么现在, 让我们一起看看这些, 曲奇饼把 97 00:06:28,584 --&gt; 00:06:32,792 (哈哈哈) 98 00:06:32,792 --&gt; 00:06:37,700 这些新鲜出炉的饼干 (⊙o⊙ )哦, 他们看起来非常棒! 99 00:06:37,700 --&gt; 00:06:39,709 ( ⊙o⊙)啊！, 这些饼非常的美味. 100 00:06:39,709 --&gt; 00:06:43,501 (⊙v⊙)嗯, 好好感受一下来自对这些饼干的渴望 101 00:06:43,501 --&gt; 00:06:46,709 (⊙o⊙)哦, 它们是如此的可爱, 如此的美好. 102 00:06:46,709 --&gt; 00:06:48,292 乘现在, 关掉这个想法! 103 00:06:48,292 --&gt; 00:06:52,200 (哈哈哈) 104 00:06:52,200 --&gt; 00:06:54,209 关掉关掉它! 105 00:06:54,209 --&gt; 00:06:57,792 你们反而更想要这些饼干了, 对嘛? 106 00:06:57,792 --&gt; 00:07:00,334 你们可以发现, 阻止想这些, 是没有用的 107 00:07:00,334 --&gt; 00:07:02,292 你根本就不能阻止它! 108 00:07:02,292 --&gt; 00:07:04,792 所以,也许,你并不需要关闭它 109 00:07:04,792 --&gt; 00:07:10,501 也许, 你可以把这盏灯留着 110 00:07:10,501 --&gt; 00:07:12,709 就像这样: 111 00:07:12,709 --&gt; 00:07:18,500 My research lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, here in Seattle, 112 00:07:18,500 --&gt; 00:07:21,792 is conducting randomized clinical trials 113 00:07:21,792 --&gt; 00:07:26,792 to see if showing people how to be willing to have their cravings 114 00:07:26,792 --&gt; 00:07:29,292 is effective for quitting smoking. 115 00:07:29,292 --&gt; 00:07:32,709 We are conducting trials and face-to-face interventions 116 00:07:32,709 --&gt; 00:07:39,209 and a telephone quit smoking hotline and a website called webquit.org 117 00:07:39,209 --&gt; 00:07:43,000 and in an app called SmartQuit. 118 00:07:43,000 --&gt; 00:07:47,417 These technologies have the potential to reach millions of people 119 00:07:47,417 --&gt; 00:07:51,292 with interventions that could save their lives. 120 00:07:51,292 --&gt; 00:07:54,918 That’s pretty amazing. 121 00:07:54,918 --&gt; 00:07:57,792 And let me tell you about the data. 122 00:07:57,792 --&gt; 00:08:01,918 When you pool together the results from six clinical trials, 123 00:08:01,918 --&gt; 00:08:04,209 all six that have been published to date, 124 00:08:04,209 --&gt; 00:08:07,083 including trials conducted by our colleagues, 125 00:08:07,083 --&gt; 00:08:10,584 what we see is that for the people who were assigned 126 00:08:10,584 --&gt; 00:08:13,627 to the avoidance approach - avoiding your cravings —- 127 00:08:13,627 --&gt; 00:08:16,000 some of them quit smoking, 128 00:08:16,000 --&gt; 00:08:18,792 and it varied depending on the study. 129 00:08:18,792 --&gt; 00:08:24,459 However, for the people who were randomly assigned to the willingness condition, 130 00:08:24,459 --&gt; 00:08:28,200 twice as many quit smoking. 131 00:08:28,200 --&gt; 00:08:30,792 Very, very encouraging. 132 00:08:30,792 --&gt; 00:08:36,082 Now, of course, the data only tell us one small part of the story. 133 00:08:36,082 --&gt; 00:08:39,792 So, to help you see willingness in action, 134 00:08:39,792 --&gt; 00:08:42,958 I’m going to weave together experiences I’ve had 135 00:08:42,958 --&gt; 00:08:45,584 in counseling people for quitting smoking. 136 00:08:45,584 --&gt; 00:08:49,100 And I’ll together refer to them as one person 137 00:08:49,100 --&gt; 00:08:50,918 that we’ll just call Jane. 138 00:08:50,918 --&gt; 00:08:56,100 So, as is typical of people who come in to want help for quitting smoking, 139 00:08:56,100 --&gt; 00:08:59,292 Jane was a 45-year-old person 140 00:08:59,292 --&gt; 00:09:02,584 who started smoking when she was a teenager. 141 00:09:02,584 --&gt; 00:09:06,000 She tried to quit smoking several times and was not successful. 142 00:09:06,000 --&gt; 00:09:08,418 So, she was very skeptical that anything “new” 143 00:09:08,418 --&gt; 00:09:10,918 was going to be helpful to her for quitting, 144 00:09:10,918 --&gt; 00:09:14,417 and yet she was really hopeful that this time would be different. 145 00:09:14,417 --&gt; 00:09:18,876 So, the first thing that I showed Jane was to be willing, 146 00:09:18,876 --&gt; 00:09:22,417 that is to be aware, of her cravings in her body. 147 00:09:22,417 --&gt; 00:09:25,300 So to notice where she felt cravings in her body. 148 00:09:25,300 --&gt; 00:09:27,000 And what I did was I asked her 149 00:09:27,000 --&gt; 00:09:31,584 to journal that, and just to track the intensity over time, 150 00:09:31,584 --&gt; 00:09:33,503 and to see if she’d smoke afterwards. 151 00:09:33,503 --&gt; 00:09:36,918 So in the middle of explaining this, she stops me and says, 152 00:09:36,918 --&gt; 00:09:42,501 “What are you talking about? I don’t have cravings, I just smoke!” 153 00:09:42,501 --&gt; 00:09:47,209 So I said, &quot;Well, why don’t you try it, and we’ll see what happens, 154 00:09:47,209 --&gt; 00:09:49,627 and if it doesn’t work, we’ll try something else.&quot; 155 00:09:49,627 --&gt; 00:09:53,051 So she came back a week later and she said, 156 00:09:53,051 --&gt; 00:09:57,390 &quot;You know, I’ve been tracking my cravings, 157 00:09:57,390 --&gt; 00:10:00,792 I’ve been tracking them all the time. 158 00:10:00,792 --&gt; 00:10:04,400 And now I can’t stop thinking about smoking! 159 00:10:04,400 --&gt; 00:10:07,083 (Laughter) 160 00:10:07,083 --&gt; 00:10:09,292 What am I supposed to do?&quot; 161 00:10:09,292 --&gt; 00:10:13,709 Well, before I tell you my answer, let’’s look behind the scenes. 162 00:10:13,709 --&gt; 00:10:15,679 Now, what was probably going on here 163 00:10:15,679 --&gt; 00:10:18,250 was that Jane was having cravings all along, 164 00:10:18,250 --&gt; 00:10:24,209 and like a lot of us, she was living on autopilot. 165 00:10:24,209 --&gt; 00:10:27,292 (Laughter) 166 00:10:27,292 --&gt; 00:10:29,709 You wake up in the morning, you smoke a cigarette, 167 00:10:29,709 --&gt; 00:10:32,009 you have a cup of coffee, you smoke a cigarette, 168 00:10:32,009 --&gt; 00:10:34,381 you get in the car, you smoke a cigarette. 169 00:10:34,381 --&gt; 00:10:38,501 We’re often just not aware of what we think, what we feel before we act. 170 00:10:38,501 --&gt; 00:10:41,918 So, my answer to Jane was to be willing, 171 00:10:41,918 --&gt; 00:10:44,107 and one of the ways I showed her to do that 172 00:10:44,107 --&gt; 00:10:48,000 was with an exercise called “I am having the thought”. 173 00:10:48,000 --&gt; 00:10:53,584 So, one of Jane’s thoughts before she had a cigarette was, 174 00:10:53,584 --&gt; 00:10:56,876 “I’m feeling a lot of stress right now, I really need a cigarette.” 175 00:10:56,876 --&gt; 00:10:58,419 So I asked her to add the phrase 176 00:10:58,419 --&gt; 00:11:00,918 “I’m having the thought” like this. 177 00:11:00,918 --&gt; 00:11:02,160 &quot;I’m having the thought 178 00:11:02,160 --&gt; 00:11:05,514 that I’m feeling a lot of stress right now I really need a cigarette.&quot; 179 00:11:05,514 --&gt; 00:11:10,417 Then I asked her to add the phrase “I’m noticing I’m having the thought,” 180 00:11:10,417 --&gt; 00:11:12,918 so &quot;I’m noticing that I’m having the thought 181 00:11:12,918 --&gt; 00:11:14,918 that I’m feeling a lot of stress right now, 182 00:11:14,918 --&gt; 00:11:16,334 I really need a cigarette.&quot; 183 00:11:16,334 --&gt; 00:11:21,918 Now, we can all do an exercise like this when we have any kind of negative thought. 184 00:11:21,918 --&gt; 00:11:26,200 Like for my thought that “I’m boring all of you with my talk” 185 00:11:26,200 --&gt; 00:11:27,709 (Laughter) 186 00:11:27,709 --&gt; 00:11:32,209 and I’m having the thought that I’m boring all of you with my talk. 187 00:11:32,209 --&gt; 00:11:35,502 So, what this exercise did is it gave me a little bit of space 188 00:11:35,502 --&gt; 00:11:37,918 between me and my thoughts. 189 00:11:37,918 --&gt; 00:11:40,083 And it’s in that space 190 00:11:40,083 --&gt; 00:11:45,870 that I can choose not to run off the stage in front of 1,500 people. 191 00:11:45,870 --&gt; 00:11:47,417 (Laughter) 192 00:11:47,417 --&gt; 00:11:50,709 And the fact is we don’t act on every thought we have, 193 00:11:50,709 --&gt; 00:11:54,350 because if we did, we’d all be in a whole lot of trouble. 194 00:11:54,350 --&gt; 00:11:56,417 (Laughter) 195 00:11:56,417 --&gt; 00:12:00,210 So, this was helpful to Jane, but there was something else 196 00:12:00,210 --&gt; 00:12:03,209 that was really difficult for Jane. 197 00:12:03,209 --&gt; 00:12:06,209 I felt a lot of compassion for her about it. 198 00:12:06,209 --&gt; 00:12:08,584 That was the judgment that she felt 199 00:12:08,584 --&gt; 00:12:14,501 from people when she would be outside smoking a cigarette. 200 00:12:14,501 --&gt; 00:12:18,501 The criticism from her husband for being a smoker, 201 00:12:18,501 --&gt; 00:12:24,292 and the self-loathing that she developed about smoking. 202 00:12:24,292 --&gt; 00:12:28,709 And she dealt with this shame by having a cigarette, 203 00:12:28,709 --&gt; 00:12:33,918 which gave her relief temporarily until the shame came back. 204 00:12:33,918 --&gt; 00:12:36,584 So, I said to Jane, 205 00:12:36,584 --&gt; 00:12:41,792 &quot;What would it be like if we tried to honor this feeling of shame 206 00:12:41,792 --&gt; 00:12:45,709 as part of the human experience? 207 00:12:45,709 --&gt; 00:12:50,600 If you had a close friend who is feeling shame about smoking,” 208 00:12:50,600 --&gt; 00:12:51,918 I said to Jane, 209 00:12:51,918 --&gt; 00:12:58,292 “what would you offer this friend as words of caring and kindness, 210 00:12:58,292 --&gt; 00:13:03,792 and could you then offer those words to yourself, Jane?&quot; 211 00:13:03,792 --&gt; 00:13:06,292 And she looked up, 212 00:13:06,292 --&gt; 00:13:12,584 and she had this look of this temporary respite from the shame, 213 00:13:12,584 --&gt; 00:13:15,918 which made it just a little bit easier next time 214 00:13:15,918 --&gt; 00:13:19,083 not to act on the craving. 215 00:13:19,083 --&gt; 00:13:21,709 So, here is the secret to self-control: 216 00:13:21,709 --&gt; 00:13:25,918 the secret to self-control is to give up control. 217 00:13:25,918 --&gt; 00:13:27,002 Because otherwise, 218 00:13:27,002 --&gt; 00:13:33,417 we get into a tug-of-war with a monster, a craving monster. 219 00:13:33,417 --&gt; 00:13:35,083 And the craving monster says, 220 00:13:35,083 --&gt; 00:13:40,500 “Come on, smoke a cigarette. Come on, have that cookie. Come on!” 221 00:13:40,500 --&gt; 00:13:42,297 And you’re on the other side saying, 222 00:13:42,297 --&gt; 00:13:45,167 &quot;No craving monster, I’m going to distract myself from you, 223 00:13:45,167 --&gt; 00:13:47,167 I’m going to ignore you, no, no, no, no.&quot; 224 00:13:47,167 --&gt; 00:13:50,553 And the craving monster says, “No, no, come on, you know you want it!” 225 00:13:50,553 --&gt; 00:13:51,829 And you’re just back here 226 00:13:51,829 --&gt; 00:13:54,244 and you’re going back and forth and back and forth 227 00:13:54,244 --&gt; 00:13:56,743 and pretty soon the craving monster overpowers you 228 00:13:56,743 --&gt; 00:13:59,324 — you have that cookie, you have that cigarette, 229 00:13:59,324 --&gt; 00:14:01,419 until the craving monster comes back. 230 00:14:01,419 --&gt; 00:14:06,292 And then you’re in the tug-of-war again doing what we’ve learned how to do. 231 00:14:06,292 --&gt; 00:14:09,203 Unless - 232 00:14:09,203 --&gt; 00:14:12,203 unless you drop the rope. 233 00:14:12,203 --&gt; 00:14:13,538 And what you discover 234 00:14:13,538 --&gt; 00:14:16,709 is that if you just allow the monster to be, 235 00:14:16,709 --&gt; 00:14:19,792 to occupy a space in your body, 236 00:14:19,792 --&gt; 00:14:21,294 you discover in a few minutes 237 00:14:21,294 --&gt; 00:14:25,918 that the craving monster is not as threatening as he appears. 238 00:14:25,918 --&gt; 00:14:29,918 And sometimes, he even goes away. 239 00:14:29,918 --&gt; 00:14:33,900 As we break for lunch, we’re going to have choices of what to eat. 240 00:14:33,900 --&gt; 00:14:40,083 (Laughter) 241 00:14:40,083 --&gt; 00:14:47,417 When you see them, try to be aware of the cravings in your body, 242 00:14:47,417 --&gt; 00:14:49,626 try to be willing to have those cravings. 243 00:14:49,626 --&gt; 00:14:52,501 See if they pass on their own. 244 00:14:52,501 --&gt; 00:14:56,294 Whatever choice you make, try to bring a spirit of caring 245 00:14:56,294 --&gt; 00:14:59,209 and kindness to yourself, 246 00:14:59,209 --&gt; 00:15:04,200 for that is the mountain that we are all climbing. 247 00:15:04,200 --&gt; 00:15:05,584 Thank you very much. 248 00:15:05,584 --&gt; 00:15:07,586 (Applause)","link":"/2020/08/22/LearnNotes/Ted2-Selfdecipline_T/"},{"title":"Advanced Molecular &amp; Cell Biology 2","text":"Cellular Biology 2 Bacterial gene are clustered by function (it could regulated by a same prone) THe invention of most cellular enzymatic mechanisms and biochemical pathways occured early in microbs and we are inherits it.

My mom was 42 years-old when I was born. And she started exercising for the first time in her life. She started by running around the block. And then, she started doing 5km raises. And then, she started doing 10km raises. And after that, she ran a marathon. And after that, my mom did it Drasalon. By the time, she was 57 years-old. My mom was tracking up hell to the base camp of mountain everest. And let me tell you about my dad. When I was a kid, my dad used to take me to the science classes. He was also my calculus teacher in high school. I want to craw under the desk. I learned something important from my mom, the value of health. And I learn something important from my dad, the value of science. And, this two values have guide me on my track through life. And they found me appreciate the epidemic we are all facing, and it’s not Ebola. Instead, it is the epidemic of unhealthy living. A half billion people world wide are OBS. And you would think that 50 year after that first US surging general support on the dangerous tobacco was published. That we be beyond of the problem of smoking. Today, a billion people worldwide use tobacco. Tobacco and obesity are two of the most preventably causes of premature death. Solving this problems is like trying to solve Ajecstuck puzzle. We are engaging in unhealthy behavior because of our genetics, because of brain neural transmitters, because of environmental effluences such as pills and media. Each of those pieces of puzzle are not things you and I can solve on our own. But, there is one piece of this puzzle that may hold the key, our choices, about what we do with our cravings to engage in addicted behaviors like smoking, or over eating. Our choices. There is a new science of self-control that may hold the key to reversing that epidemics. It’s called willingness. Willingness means allowing you craving to come and to go or not acting on that, like smoking or eating unhealthy. But actually, I’m not talk about will power, I’m not talking about power through your cravings. Instead, I am talking about different notion of cravings. That looks like this, dropping the struggle with your cravings, opening up to them, letting them be there, and making peace with them. Now, at this point, you maybe very skeptical. I was. When I first heard about it years ago, I friend of my came to me with a book on willingness. He said, Jonathan, this book will changing your life for every. And I said, Ooh, ok, yeah, umm, year, I’ll check it out. So, I went through it, ummm, it is a bunch of psychical bible. I tossed it aside. Until some years later, when my wife brought me to a work shop on unwillingness of university of Washington. And I was bullowned away. So then, I read the book, and then, I read a lot of book on willingness. And I got trained in it. And what I learned was willingness is apart of acceptance in the accept and commitment therapy approach to be behavior change. It’s a broad approach to be behavior change, it’s been used to help people with anxiety disorder, with addictions, even some innovative companies are now using it to helping improving their employees performance and reduce their distress. Now, to understand why I was billowed away, you have to understand the world that I live in. In my research world, a common way you help people quit smoking and lose weight is you teaching them to avoid cravings, avoid thinking about smokings, distraked yourself from food cravings. There’s a song from a Broadway’s show, and capshows this perfectly, it goes like this. When you start to get confuse because of fuzzes in your head, don’t fell thoughts feelings. Hold them in instead, turn it off, like a light switch just go click we do it all the time when you feeling certain feeling such as don’t seems right, switch those packing feeling like a reading light, and turn them off. We all living in this world, with the song we keep hearing is turn off the bad feelings. Now, let’s take a look at this cookies. They just came out of the oven. Ooooh, they are so good. Oooh, they are so delicious. Enmmm, just feeling the craving to eat that feelings. Oooh, they are lovely, they are so good. Now, turn it off. turn it off. You want this cookies even more now, right? You see the futility of “turn it off”. You can’t turn it off. And maybe, you don’t have to. Maybe, you can leave the light on. Here is how. My research lab at Fred Parkinson Cancer Research Center here in Cato. It’s conducting random-mize clinical trails to see if showing people how to be willing to have their craving is affective to quite smoking. We are conducting trails in face to face intervention, and a telephone quick smoke hot-line, and a website called webquite.org, and an App called smart quite. This technology help the potential to reach millions people with their interventions, we could save life. That’s pretty amazing. And let me tell you about the data. When you pull together the result from six clinical trials, all six had been published today, including trails conducted by our colleagues. What we see is that for the people who were signed to the avoid approach, avoiding your cravings, some of them quite smoking, and very depending on the study. However, for the people who are randomly signed for willingness condition, twice as many quite smoking. Every every encouraging. Now, of course, the date only tell us one part of the story. So, to help you see willingness in action, I am going to wave together experiences I’ve had to consulting people to quiting smoking. And our together refer, so there is one person we’ll just call him Jane. So, as this is typical people who coming to once helping quiting smoking, Jane was a 45 years-old person, who started smoking when she was a teenager. She tried quite smoking several times but not successful. So, she was very skeptical that anything new was getting be helpful to her for quite. And she was really hopeful that this time would be different. So, the first thing that I show Jane was to be willing, that is to be aware of her craving in her body. So, to know this where she cravings in her body. And when I did it this to asking a journal that, and just to track the intensity over time, and see if she smoke afterward. So, a little bit of explain that she stops me, she saids, “what are you talking about? I don’t have cravings. I just smoke”. So, I said, “Well, why not you try it, and we will see what happens, and if doesn’t happens, we try something else”. So, she came back a week later. She said, you know, “I am dragging my cravings. I have been dragging them all the time. And now, I can’t stopping thinking about smoking. What am I suppose to do?” Well, if I tell you, my answer, let’s look behind the sites. Well, what’s probably going on here was that Jane was having craving all alone. And like a lot of us, she lives on autopaletor. You wake up in the morning, smoke a cigarette, you have a cup of coffee, you smoke a cigarette, you get in to the car, you smoke a cigarette. We are often just not aware what we thinking before we act. So, I answer to Jane was to be willing. And one of the way I show her to do that was what the exercise called, I am having the thought. So, one of Jane thoughts, before he had cigarette was, I fill a lot of stress I know, I really need a cigarette. So, I ask he after freeze, I’m having the thought, like this. I’m having the thought that I’m feeling lot’s of stress done, I really need a cigarette. Than, I asking her another phrase, I notice that I have the thought. So, I’m noticing that I’m having the thought, then I having lot’s of stress now, I really need a cigarette. Now, we can all do an exercise like this when we have any kind of negative thought, like for my thought, that I’m boring all of you by my talking. And, I’m having the thought that I’m boring all of you with my talk. So, what the exercise did is give me a little bit space between me and my thoughts. And it’s in that’s space, that I can choice not to run out of the stage from 500 people. And the fact is, we don’t act on every thoughts we had because if we did, we all be in hall a lot of trouble. So, this was helpful to Jane. But there was something else, that was really difficult for Jane, and I feel lot’s of compassion about her. And that was the judgment that she feel from people when she would be outside smoking a outside cigarette. There criticism from her husband for been a smoker, and the self-loading that she developed about smoking, and she dealt with ashame, by having a cigarette which give her relive temporarily into the shame came back. So, I said to Jane, what would be like if we tried to honer this feel of shame as part of human experiment. If you had a close friend, who was feeling ashame about smoking, I said to Jane, “What would you offer to this friend as words of caring very kindness? And could you then, offer those words to yourself Jane.” And she looked up, and she had this look of this temporary respite from the shame which made just a little bit easier to next time, not acting to craving. So, here is the secret of self control. The secret of self control is to give up control. Because otherwise, we get into a target of war with a monster, a craving monster. And a craving monster saids, “Common, smoke a cigarette; common, have that cookie; Common!” And you are on the other side say, “No, craving monster, I’m gonna distract by you; I am ignoring you, no no no” And the craving monster says, “Yeah, you know, common, you know, you want it.” And you just back here, you are going back and forth and back and forth, and pretty soon, the craving monster over powers you, you have the cookies, you have that cigarette until the craving monster come back. And you are on the target word doing again. Doing what we learned how to do. In last, in last, you drop the rope. And when you discovered is if you just allow the monster to be, to occupy a space in your body, you discover that that the craving monster is not as threatening as it appears. And some times, it even goes away. As we break for lunch, we gonna have choices what to eat. When you see them, try to be aware of the craves in your body. Try to be willing to have this craving, see if they passed on there own. And whatever choices you made, try to bring a spirited of caring and kindness to yourself, for that is the mountain that we are all climbing. Thank you very much!

It’s called willingness. Willingness means allowing you craving to come a nd to go, while not acting on them_ by smoking or eating unhealthy. But actually, I’m nd to go or not acting on that, like smoking or eating unhealthy. But actually, I’m not talking about will_power, and I’m not talking about “power through your cravings.” I not talk about will power, I’m not talking about power through your cravings. I nstead, I’m talking about a different notion of cravings that looks like this: droppin nstead, I am talking about different notion of cravings. That looks like this, droppin g the struggle with your cravings. Opening up to them, letting them be there, and making g the struggle with your cravings, opening up to them, letting them be there, and making peace with them. Now at this point you may be very skeptical. I was_ when I first he peace with them. Now, at this point, you maybe very skeptical. I was. When I first he ard about it years ago. A friend of mine came to me with a book on willingness. He said, ard about it years ago, I friend of my came to me with a book on willingness. He said, &quot;Jonathan, this book will change_ your life for_ever!&quot; And I said “O_h, OK… Yeah… Jonathan, this book will changing your life for every. And I said, Ooh, ok, yeah, u ___ yeah, I’ll check it out.” So_ I went through it and thought, “Nah, this is a bunch o mm, year, I’ll check it out.

Turn it off like a light switch just go click. We do it all the time when in instead, turn it off, like a light switch just go click we do it all the time when you’re feeling certain feeling_s that just don’t seem right. Treat those pesky feel you feeling certain feeling such as don’t seems right, switch those packing feel ings like a reading light_ and turn them off. We all live in this world, w__here the ing like a reading light, and turn them off. We all living in this world, with the song we keep hearing is “turn off the bad feelings.” Now, let’s take a look at these coo song we keep hearing is turn off the bad feelings. Now, let’s take a look at this coo kies. They just came out of the oven oo_h, they are so good! A__h, they’re so delicio kies. They just came out of the oven. Ooooh, they are so good. Oooh, they are so delicio us. M_m-mm, just feel that craving to eat those cookie_s. Oo_h, they’re lovely, they us. Enmmm, just feeling the craving to eat that feelings. Oooh, they are lovely, they 're so good. Now, turn it off! Turn it off! You want those cookies even more now, right are so good. Now, turn it off. turn it off. You want this cookies even more now, right ? You see the futility of trying to turn it off_. You can’t turn it off! And maybe_ you ? You see the futility of &quot;turn it off&quot;. You can’t turn it off. And maybe, you don’t have to. Maybe, you can leave the light on. Here is how: My research lab at the F don’t have to. Maybe, you can leave the light on. Here is how. My research lab at F red Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, here in Seattle, i__s conducting random__ized cli red Parkinson Cancer Research Center here in Cato. It's conducting random-mize cli nical tr_ials to see if showing people how to be willing to have their cravings is effec nical trails to see if showing people how to be willing to have their craving is affec tive for quitting smoking. We are conducting tr_ials and face-to-face interventions and tive to quite smoking. We are conducting trails in face to face intervention, and a telephone quit_ smoking hot_line_ and a website called webquit_.org_ and in an app cal a telephone quick smoke hot-line, and a website called webquite.org, and an App cal led SmartQ_uit. These technologies have the potential to reach millions of people wit led smart quite. This technology help the potential to reach millions people wit h i___nterventions that could save their lives. That’s pretty amazing. And let me t h their interventions, we could save life. That’s pretty amazing. And let me t ell you about the data. When you pool together the results from six clinical trials, all ell you about the data. When you pull together the result from six clinical trials, all six that have been published to date, including tr_ials conducted by our colleagues, wh six had been published today, including trails conducted by our colleagues. Wh at we see is that for the people who were assigned to the avoidance approach - avoiding at we see is that for the people who were signed to the avoid approach, avoiding your cravings —- some of them quit smoking, and it varied depending on the study. Howev your cravings, some of them quite smoking, and very depending on the study. Howev er, for the people who were randomly assigned to the willingness condition, twice as man er, for the people who are randomly signed for willingness condition, twice as man y quit smoking. V_ery, very encouraging. Now, of course, the data only tell us one sma y quite smoking. Every every encouraging. Now, of course, the date only tell us one ll part of the story. So, to help you see willingness in action, I’m going to weave tog part of the story. So, to help you see willingness in action, I am going to wave tog ether experiences I’ve had in counsel_ing people for quitting smoking. And I’ll together ether experiences I’ve had to consulting people to quiting smoking. And our together refer_ to them_ as one person that we’ll just call Jane. So, as __is typical of refer, so there is one person we’ll just call him Jane. So, as this is typical people who come in to want_ help for quitting smoking, Jane was a 45-year_-old person_ people who coming to once helping quiting smoking, Jane was a 45 years-old person, who started smoking when she was a teenager. She tried to quit_ smoking several times a who started smoking when she was a teenager. She tried quite smoking several times b nd was not successful. So, she was very skeptical that anything “new” was go__ing to be ut not successful. So, she was very skeptical that anything new was getting be helpful to her for quitting, and yet she was really hopeful that this time would be diff helpful to her for quite. And she was really hopeful that this time would be diff erent. So, the first thing that I showed Jane was to be willing, that is to be aware, of erent. So, the first thing that I show Jane was to be willing, that is to be aware of her cravings in her body. So_ to no__t_ice where she felt cravings in her body. And wh her craving in her body. So, to know this where she cravings in her body. And wh at I did wa____s I_ asked her to journal that, and just to track the intensity over time en I did it this to asking a journal that, and just to track the intensity over time , and to see if she’d smoke afterwards. So_ in th_e middle of explaining this, she sto , and see if she smoke afterward. So, a little bit of explain that she sto ps me_ and say_s, “What are you talking about? I don’t have cravings, I just smoke!”_ So ps me, she saids, &quot;what are you talking about? I don’t have cravings. I just smoke&quot;. So _ I said, &quot;Well, why don’t you try it, and we’__ll see what happens, and if it doesn’t w , I said, &quot;Well, why not you try it, and we will see what happens, and if doesn’t h ork, we’ll try something else_.&quot; So_ she came back a week later and she said, “You kn appens, we try something else&quot;. So, she came back a week later. She said, you kn ow, I’ve been tracking my cravings, I’_ve been tracking them all the time. And now I ow, &quot;I am dragging my cravings. I have been dragging them all the time. And now, I can’t stop____ thinking about smoking! What am I supposed to do?” Well, before I tell yo can’t stopping thinking about smoking. What am I suppose to do?&quot; Well, if I tell yo u my answer, let’’s look behind the scenes. Now_, what was probably going on here was t u, my answer, let’s look behind the sites. Well, what's probably going on here was t hat Jane was having cravings all along, and like a lot of us, she was living on autopilo hat Jane was having craving all alone. And like a lot of us, she lives on autopale t. You wake up in the morning, you smoke a cigarette, you have a cup of coffee, you sm tor. You wake up in the morning, smoke a cigarette, you have a cup of coffee, you sm oke a cigarette, you get in t___he car, you smoke a cigarette. We’re often just not awa oke a cigarette, you get in to the car, you smoke a cigarette. We are often just not awa re of what we think, what we feel before we act. So, my answer to Jane was to be willing re what we thinking before we act. So, I answer to Jane was to be willing , and one of the ways I showed her to do that was wi_th an_ exercise called_ &quot;I am havin . And one of the way I show her to do that was what the exercise called, I am havin g the thought&quot;. So, one of Jane’s thoughts before she had a cigarette was, &quot;I’m feeling g the thought. So, one of Jane thoughts, before he had cigarette was, I fill a lot of stress right now, I really need a cigarette.&quot; So I asked her to add the_ phr a lot of stress I know, I really need a cigarette. So, I ask he after fr as_e “I’m having the thought” like this. “I’m having the thought that I’m feeling a lot eeze, I’m having the thought, like this. I’m having the thought that I’m feeling lot __ of stress right now I really need a cigarette.” Then_ I asked_ her to add the_ phrase 's of stress done, I really need a cigarette. Than, I asking her another phrase _ &quot;I’m noticing I’m having the thought,&quot; so_ &quot;I’m noticing that I’m having the though , I notice that I have the thought. So, I’m noticing that I’m having the though t that I’m feeling a lot_ of stress right now, I really need a cigarette.” Now, we can t, then I having lot's of stress now, I really need a cigarette. Now, we can all do an exercise like this when we have any kind of negative thought. Like for my tho all do an exercise like this when we have any kind of negative thought, like for my tho ught_ that “I’m boring all of you with my talk”___ and_ I’m having the thought that I’m ught, that I’m boring all of you by my talking. And, I’m having the thought that I’m boring all of you with my talk. So, what this exercise did is it gave me a little bit of boring all of you with my talk. So, what the exercise did is give me a little bit space between me and my thoughts. And it’s in that__ space that I can choose not to ru space between me and my thoughts. And it’s in that's space, that I can choice not to ru n of___f the stage in front of 1,500 people. And the fact is we don’t act on every thou n out of the stage from 500 people. And the fact is, we don’t act on every thou ght we have, because if we did, we’d all be in a whole __lot of trouble. So, this was h ghts we had because if we did, we all be in hall a lot of trouble. So, this was h elpful to Jane, but there was something else that was really difficult for Jane. I elpful to Jane. But there was something else, that was really difficult for Jane, and I fe_lt a lot of compassion f_or her about it. That was the judgment that she fe_lt fr feel lot's of compassion about her. And that was the judgment that she feel fr om people when she would be outside smoking a ____cigarette. The criticism from he om people when she would be outside smoking a outside cigarette. There criticism from he r husband for being a smoker, and the self-loathing that she developed about smoking. An r husband for been a smoker, and the self-loading that she developed about smoking, an d she dealt with this shame_ by having a cigarette, which gave her reli_ef temporarily u d she dealt with ashame, by having a cigarette which give her relive temporarily i ntil the shame came back. So, I said to Jane, “What would it be like if we tried to hono nto the shame came back. So, I said to Jane, what would be like if we tried to hone r this feeling of shame as part of the human experi_ence? If you had a close friend who r this feel of shame as part of human experiment. If you had a close friend, who i_s feeling shame about smoking,” I said to Jane, “what would you offer t___his friend was feeling ashame about smoking, I said to Jane, ”What would you offer to this friend as words of caring and_ kindness, and could you then_ offer those words to yourself, Ja as words of caring very kindness? And could you then, offer those words to yourself Ja ne?&quot; And she looked up, and she had this look of this temporary respite from the shame, ne.&quot; And she looked up, and she had this look of this temporary respite from the shame which made it just a little bit easier next time not to act on the craving. So, he which made just a little bit easier to next time, not acting to craving. So, he re is the secret to_ self-control: the secret to_ self-control is to give up control. Be re is the secret of self control. The secret of self control is to give up control. Be cause otherwise, we get into a tu_g-of-war with a monster, a craving monster.

For instance, the α subunit is crucial for initiation and interaction with regulatory proteins. Sigma factors, in part, determine promoter specificity Sigma factors are essential for guiding the RNA polymerase to specific sets of genes, ensuring the right genes are expressed under certain conditions. Two modes of transcriptional termination in bacteria These are the Rho-independent and Rho-dependent mechanisms. Each has its unique sequence cues and processes to halt transcription. Transcription Initiation In Four Steps Forming the closed promoter complex This is the initial binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter region without unwinding the DNA. Forming the open promoter complex Here, the DNA around the promoter region unwinds, providing a single-stranded template for transcription. Incorporating the first few nucleotides RNA polymerase begins the synthesis of the RNA strand. It’s a crucial step, ensuring the fidelity of the process. Promoter clearance After successful initiation, the RNA polymerase moves forward, leaving the promoter region, and enters the elongation phase of transcription. → Source $\\sigma$ Factor is Recycled After initiation, the sigma factor can dissociate from the RNA polymerase and be used again for another round of transcription initiation. This recycling process is efficient for the cell. It is discoverd in a very simply assay. After add the fresh core, it got more transcription products. Red curve: Only one round of chain initiation is possible at low ionic strength because (core) polymerase does not dissociate from DNA. Green curve: Fresh core polymerase added. (Products surge) Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiment: retain the core during the cycle. “FRET studies have been pivotal in understanding sigma factor dynamics during transcription.

By analyzing the rate and extent of transcription, insights into the efficiency of the transcription process under various conditions can be obtained. Objective: To mutate a gene’s promoter and observe the effects of mutations on the accuracy and efficiency of transcription.Requirements: To check whether transcription is accurate, i.e., starts at the right place. To quantify how much of this accurate transcription has occurred. P103; Figure 5.31 Methodology: Preparation of DNA Fragment: Start with a DNA fragment containing the gene you want to transcribe. Restriction Enzyme Cutting: Cut the fragment with a restriction enzyme in the middle of the transcribed region. In Vitro Transcription: Transcribe the truncated gene fragment in vitro using labeled nucleotides, so the resulting transcript is labeled. Run-Off Mechanism: Since the gene has been cut in the middle, the RNA polymerase will reach the end and “run off”, giving the method its name. Measure Transcript Length: The length of the run-off transcript confirms the starting point of transcription based on the known location of the restriction site. Advantages: Simplicity: Compared to S1 mapping or primer extension, run-off transcription is simpler. Quantitative: It can serve as a quantitative method to measure the rate of in vitro transcription. Limitations: In Vitro Only: The method relies on in vitro transcription and cannot provide information about cellular transcript concentrations. Accuracy: It is effective only for genes that are accurately transcribed in vitro. Applications: After identifying the physiological transcription start site through other methods like S1 mapping or primer extension, run-off transcription can be used to quantify transcription rates in vitro. Summary: Run-off transcription is a simple, yet effective method for studying the efficiency and accuracy of transcription for a gene, especially in in vitro settings. It is particularly useful for quantitative analysis of transcription rates. Test the speed of the transcription Bound $\\sigma$ Factor Promotes RNAP Pausing Abortive Initiation Predominates Background: Until 1980, it was widely believed that transcription initiation was completed upon the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, connecting the first two nucleotides in the RNA chain. Breakthrough Study by Carpousis and Gralla: Experimental Setup: E. coli RNA polymerase DNA with a mutant E. coli lac promoter (lac UV5 promoter) Heparin (prevents reassociation between DNA and RNA polymerase) Labeled ATP (to label RNA products) Methodology: Incubated the polymerase, DNA, heparin, and labeled ATP. Ran gel electrophoresis on the products to measure their sizes. Key Findings:Presence of Small Oligonucleotides: They found small RNA fragments ranging from 2-6 nucleotides (nt) in length.Sequence Matching: The sequences of these small oligonucleotides matched the beginning of the expected transcript from the lac promoter.Many Oligonucleotides per Polymerase: When the amount of these oligonucleotides was compared to the number of RNA polymerases, there were many oligonucleotides per polymerase. P127; Figure 6.7 Implications: Abortive Transcripts: The polymerase was producing many small, abortive transcripts without leaving the promoter region. Complex Initiation Process: Transcription initiation is more complex than previously thought, involving a stage where multiple abortive transcripts are produced. Role of Heparin: Heparin in the assay prevented free RNA polymerase from reassociating with the DNA, confirming that the abortive transcripts were made by the same polymerase without it detaching from the DNA. Follow-up Research: Other researchers have corroborated these findings, even discovering abortive transcripts up to 9 or 10 nt in size. Summary: The study by Carpousis and Gralla showed that transcription initiation is a complex process involving the generation of multiple abortive transcripts. This groundbreaking work has significantly deepened our understanding of the transcription initiation process in E. coli. Electro Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) P109; Figure 5.36 Background: Understanding DNA–protein interactions is crucial for various aspects of molecular biology, including gene regulation. Gel mobility shift assay, also known as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), is a technique that allows for the visualization of these interactions. Principle: The basic idea is that a small, labeled DNA fragment will move through an electrophoretic gel much more slowly when it is bound to a protein compared to when it is unbound. Methodology: Preparation: A short, double-stranded DNA fragment is labeled. Binding: This labeled DNA is then mixed with the protein of interest. Electrophoresis: The DNA-protein complex is subjected to gel electrophoresis. Detection: The gel is exposed to autoradiography to visualize the labeled species. Key Findings: Naked DNA: Without any bound protein, the labeled DNA shows high mobility in the gel (Lane 1). DNA-Protein Complex: When the DNA is bound to a protein, its mobility through the gel decreases significantly (Lane 2). This is the basic “shift” that gives the assay its name. Supershift: When the DNA is bound to two proteins, its mobility decreases even further (Lane 3). This is termed a “supershift” and can involve either another DNA-binding protein, a protein that binds to the first protein, or an antibody specific to the first protein. Applications: Study of Protein-DNA Interactions: Allows researchers to understand which proteins can bind to a specific DNA sequence. Supershift Analysis: Useful in identifying secondary proteins or antibodies that can further bind to the DNA-protein complex. Quantitative Analysis: The degree of shift can also provide quantitative insights into the binding affinities. Summary: EMSA is a powerful and versatile technique for studying DNA–protein interactions. It allows not only the qualitative identification of interacting proteins but also offers clues about the binding dynamics through supershifts.

Dimethylsulfate (DMS) Footprinting: Uses DMS to methylate adenine bases in DNA. Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting: Uses hydroxyl radicals to cleave DNA. DNase Footprinting Steps: End-Label DNA: Only one strand is labeled per experiment. Protein Binding: The target protein is allowed to bind to the DNA. DNase I Treatment: Mild conditions used to ensure only one cut per DNA molecule on average. Protein Removal: The protein is removed to leave only the DNA. Gel Electrophoresis: DNA fragments are separated on a high-resolution gel. Control &amp; Multiple Concentrations: A control with DNA alone is included. Different protein concentrations are tested to observe gradual disappearance of bands. Outcome: The “footprint” region on the gel corresponds to the DNA region protected by the protein, revealing the protein’s binding site on the DNA. Significance: Helps in identifying the exact DNA regions or bases involved in binding with a specific protein. Strong Promoters Have Another Conserved DNA Element -35 box and -10 box.

Rho helices releases transcript and causes termination Initiation or Termination can be Used for Regulation Significant: In the microbes, a single operon usually activate a serious of protein for a pathway. But we usually only need apart of the genes as a result, the termination study is very important in microbe engineering Housekeeping vs. Regulated “Housekeeping genes are essential for the day-to-day functions of the cell and are continuously transcribed. On the other hand, regulated genes are transcribed only under specific conditions. The cell uses various transcription factors and sigma factors to control the expression of these genes.” Expression of housekeeping genes is constitutive (essentially) Housekeeping genes have strong promoters and are efficiently and nearly continuously transcribed *housekeeping genes whose products are required at low levels have weaker promoters Regulated genes are expressed at different levels under different conditions using specific operators/response elements within each promoter Sigma Factor Directed Transcription Programs “E. coli, a model bacterium, utilizes different sigma factors to control the transcription of various sets of genes. Depending on the environmental conditions, E. coli can switch between these sigma factors to ensure the appropriate genes are being expressed.” Bacterial Gene Regulators E. coli can choose between 7 sigma factors and about 350 transcription factors to fine tune its transcriptional output An Rev Micro Vol. 57: 441-466 T.

Ba: almost all close to the gene !!! How do you find an Operator/Response Element? - Operators - Many TFs bind inverted repeats as dimers - More interactions = greater affinity - Enhancer - Promoter ‘Bashing’ lacZ could be a report aod transcription reporter and change the color of the cell in this assay. - Linker-scanner Mutagenesis to Refine Position of Promoter Proximal Elements (after the Promoter ‘Bashing’) peron Bacteria and viruses often express functionally operative genes from a single promoter to help insure uniform expression DNA order: Activator binding site promoter, Repressor binding sit (Operator) Example: Lactose (Lac) Operon Lactose permease (Lacy) B-Galactosidase (LacZ) Thiogalactoside transacetylase (LacA) !!! What about the Lactose operon: The lac operon in E. coli is one of the most well-studied systems for gene regulation. This operon contains genes for enzymes required for the metabolism of lactose, a disaccharide sugar. The operon consists of three genes: - **lacZ**: Codes for \\(\\beta\\)-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose. - **lacY**: Codes for galactoside permease, a transport protein that facilitates the entry of lactose into the cell. - **lacA**: Codes for galactoside transacetylase, whose function is not entirely clear. These genes are transcribed into a single polycistronic mRNA, meaning that they are expressed together. This allows for coordinated control of these functionally related genes. - **Negative Control: The Brake** In the absence of lactose, a protein called the lac repressor binds to the operator region of the operon, blocking RNA polymerase and thus preventing transcription. This is a form of negative control; it keeps the operon turned off when lactose is not present, which is efficient for the cell. - **Positive Control: The Accelerator** The lac operon also has a system for positive control, mediated by an activator protein that responds to glucose levels in the cell. This activator is cAMP-CAP (cAMP Receptor Protein). When glucose levels are low, cAMP levels are high, allowing CAP to bind and enhance the transcription of the lac operon. - **Diauxic Growth: Switching from Glucose to Lactose** When E. coli is grown in a medium containing both glucose and lactose, it exhibits diauxic growth. The bacteria consume glucose first and only switch to lactose metabolism once glucose is depleted. This switch involves a lag phase where the lac operon is activated, allowing the cells to make the enzymes needed for lactose metabolism. - Advantages of Dual Control 1. **Economic Efficiency**: Negative control ensures that the enzymes for lactose metabolism are not produced when lactose is not present. This is energy-efficient. 2. **Resource Prioritization**: Positive control ensures that even if lactose is present, the lac operon will not be fully activated if glucose is also available. This allows E. coli to prioritize the easier-to-metabolize glucose. In summary, the lac operon is a sophisticated system that allows E. coli to adapt to changing nutritional conditions efficiently, ensuring that it utilizes available resources in a manner that is both effective and economical. The Operon Model (History) A landmark in the history of Molecular Biology was the proposal of the operon model of genetic regulation by François Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961. The core of the model was that the level of proteins in cells was controlled at a genetic level. The theory also predicted the existence of mRNA-an unstable intermediate between the genome and the expressed protein. Before this work the prevailing model was called the instruction hypothesis that stated that all proteins were present in a cell, but that in the absence of an inducer they were not properly folded and were inactive. Jacob and Monod were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 for their work on characterising genes involved in lactose utilization Differential Growth based on Carbon Source Glucose is more rapidly used than lactose, so cells grow faster on glucose. When both present growth is bi- phasic, which is called a diauxic shift. When you mix up them, the bacteria make the choice. They know when and how to switch the strategies. Cell numberBiological Purpose of Lac Operon LacZ gene: encodes $\\beta$ -galactosidase enzyme that breaks down disaccharide lactose into glucose and galactose to be used as source of energy for cell. LacY gene: encodes $\\beta$ -galactoside permease, a membrane-bound protein that helps transport lactose across the membrane of cell. LacA gene: encodes  -galactoside transacetylase enzyme involved in catabolism of disaccharide (exact role is less clear) Genetic Screen Based on Enzymatic Activity (Blue: lacZ activity) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-$\\beta$D-galactoside Natural &amp; Synthetic Small Molecules IPTG is a non-metabolized analog of allolactose that induces Lac operon but is not broken down by enzymes. Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose linked in a  configuration (1-&gt;4). -galactosidase, the product of the lacZ gene, cleaves this disaccharide into galactose and glucose which can then both be metabolized by the cell. E. coli does not always make this enzyme. It is an inducible enzyme which is synthesized only when lactose is present and when glucose is absent from the growth media. Glucose is one of the few sugars which E. coli will use preferentially over all other sugars because it can be directly routed into glycolysis after phosphorylation without any other modifications. Merodiploids Helped to Unravel the Role of Genes in the lac operon Studying the Lac Operon Isolation and analysis of mutants defective in Lac operon function allowed Jacob and Monod to formulate an accurate Lac operon model PRIOR to the advent of molecular cloning e.g., wild type E. coli form colonies that are blue on IPTG/ XGAL plates and white on XGAL plates Mutants that form white colonies on IPTG/XGAL plates can be isolated * this phenotype is often due to a mutation in a Lac structural gene * the number and location of Lac structural genes can be identified by complementation analysis Mutants that form blue colonies on XGAL (no IPTG) can be isolated * this phenotype is often due to a mutation in either the Lac repressor gene or Lac operator * Lac repressor versus operator mutations can be distinguished by cis-trans test F’ plasmids carrying different pieces of E. coli chromosome can be isolated in HFR strains, allowing the creation of partial diploids. F’ plasmid can carry wild type or mutant versions of Lac operon between strains Complementation Analysis and Cis-Trans Tests Phenotypes and Genotypes of Mutants Defective in Lac Operon Function Lower case letter with superscript asterisk indicates location of mutation In practice, you would not know the location; you would only know the phenotypes (blue or white color on XGAL/IPTG or XGAL) of the haploid (or homozygous diploid) and the heterozygous diploid e.g., The diploid resulting from conjugating mutants 2 and 3 give a normal phenotype, consistent with mutations 1 and 2 being recessive and located in different structural genes (i.e., in the diploid there is at least one normal copy of each gene and a correspondingly normal protein) Mutaion -&gt; got the different phynotype -&gt; trans is protine, cis is DNA. -&gt; Bind the two mutation: Make the crosses and repeat the phenotype. They don’t know what are they yet. The name is made by them and the mechanim are solved years later after the sequencing techs. ‘Trans’ and ‘Cis’ In genetic terminology: The lac repressor is a trans-acting element trans = across The operator is a cis-acting element cis=near The lac repressor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that Negatively regulates expression of the lac operon structural genes. Trans Complementation Merodiploid: lacZ - / F’ lacY - lacI lacO lacZ lacY lacA lacI lacO lacZ lacY lacA ‘Simple’ Mechanism for Gene Regulation by Lac Repressor P170; Figure 7.3 Negative Control Operon naturally “on.” Turned “off” by repressor protein from lacI gene. Allosteric Regulation Repressor is allosteric; its shape changes. Inducer is allolactose, changes repressor shape. Changed repressor can’t bind to operator, operon “on.” Basal Level &amp; Initial Activation Repression “leaky,” small amounts of β-galactosidase and permease always present. Enough for initial lactose uptake and allolactose creation. Positive Feedback (Snowball Effect) Derepression leads to more β-galactosidase and permease. More lactose uptake and allolactose creation. Operon stays “on” if lactose present and glucose absent. Summary Negative control via repressor. Allosteric regulation via allolactose. Initial activation via “leaky” repression. Positive feedback maintains activation. Lactose Levels “Tune” the Response In the absence of lactose there are only 1-5 molecules of each of the lacZYA proteins in the cell. Following induction, up to 5000 molecules of - galactosidase can accumulate within minutes. As lactose is cleaved and used as a carbon source for growth the lactose levels drop. Eventually free repressor molecules will accumulate once more and the lac operon will be switched off. Impact of Inducer on Repressor DNA binding P174; Figure 7.6 Challenges Faced The lac repressor is in very low concentration in the cell. No easy assay to identify the protein was available. Strategies Used Used a mutant E. coli strain with repressor mutation (lacI t). This mutation made the repressor bind to IPTG (isopropylthiogalactoside) more tightly. This allowed for detection of the repressor in very impure extracts. Purification Gilbert and Müller-Hill were able to purify the protein because they could now detect it. Operator-Binding Studies Conducted by Melvin Cohn and colleagues. Used nitrocellulose filter-binding assay. Results Typical saturation curve observed for repressor–operator binding in the absence of inducer. No binding observed in the presence of the synthetic inducer, IPTG. Summary Gilbert and Müller-Hill successfully purified the lac repressor using a mutant strain. Cohn’s team demonstrated that inducer (IPTG) blocks repressor–operator binding. Protein Allostery (Induced Conformational Changes) Lac Repressor Does Not Prevent RNAP Binding Unknow sours P175; Figure 7.8 Traditional Assumption: Assumed that lac repressor denies RNA polymerase access to the promoter. Contradictory Evidence Pastan’s 1971 Experiment: Showed that RNA polymerase could bind to the lac promoter even in the presence of repressor. Straney and Crothers (1987): Showed that polymerase and repressor can bind together to the lac promoter. Alternative Explanations Straney and Crothers: Suggested repressor blocks the formation of an open promoter complex. Krummel and Chamberlin: Proposed that repressor blocks the transition from the initial transcribing complex to the elongation state, trapping the polymerase in a nonproductive state. Supporting Evidence Jookyung Lee and Alex Goldfarb’s Experiment Used a run-off transcription assay. Found that RNA polymerase is engaged on the DNA template even in the presence of repressor. Noted the appearance of shortened abortive transcripts (about 6 nt long) in the presence of repressor, suggesting repressor may lock the polymerase into a nonproductive state. Summary Repressor doesn’t seem to block RNA polymerase from accessing the lac promoter. Evidence suggests that the repressor may lock the polymerase into a nonproductive state, limiting it to making only abortive transcripts. What is the Mechanism of Repression? Influence of Regulators on RNAP:Promoter Complexes $$ R + P \\underset{K_ B}{\\rightleftharpoons} RP_ c \\underset{k_ 2}{\\rightarrow} RP_ o $$ R is RNA polymerase P is the promoter RPc is the closed promoter complex RPo is the open promoter complex. KB Definition: Indicates RNA polymerase’s binding affinity to a promoter. Influenced by: Repressors or activators affecting RNA polymerase binding. k2 Definition: Represents the rate-limiting step in forming an open complex; its physical meaning can vary between promoters. Influenced by: Repressors or activators affecting RNA polymerase-promoter interactions. Insights Understanding KB and k2 helps in deciphering the effects of auxiliary proteins on RNA polymerase-promoter dynamics. It can hint at how the binding affinity is influenced and the complexities involved in open complex formation. Impact of Repressor on RNAP At the lacUV5 promoter, the values of KB and k2 in the presence or absence of repressor are: Condition KB (M⁻¹) k2 (s⁻¹) No repressor 1.9 x 10⁷ M⁻¹ 6.7 x 10⁻² s⁻¹ With repressor 2.5 x 10⁹ M⁻¹ 2.5 x 10⁻² s⁻¹ Data from Straney &amp; Crothers (1987) Cell 51: 699-707. The UV5 mutation changes the -10 region of the lacP promoter so that it more closely resembles the consensus -10 sequence. It is a stronger promoter than lacP. These data indicate that the lactose repressor INCREASES the binding of RNAP 130-fold; suggest that repressor might be considered a activator. Repressor DECREASES k2 3-fold. Repressor Dimers Bind on Same Face of DNA Unknown By insert the DNA fragment between the operator and UV5, the transcription efficiency is changed. Key Findings: Repression maxima: Occur at distances integral to the DNA double helix pitch (59.5, 70.5, 81.5, 92.5, 115.5, 150.5 nm). Wild-type lac operon: Has a 92.5 nm spacer distance between operators. Gal operon: Features a 115.5 nm spacer distance between operators. Longer distances: Display smaller effects, with distances over 400 bp having little to no impact. Non-integral multiples: No repression observed, aligning with the DNA looping model’s predictions. Implications: DNA Looping Model: The observations support a model where interaction is easy when proteins are bound on the same DNA face without needing torsional changes. DNA Pitch: Estimated to be 11.1 bp or 3.4 nm in vivo, based on repression maxima data. Limitations: Distances under 59.5 nm could not be measured due to interference with the promoter.

A protein involved in gene regulation was discovered and named CAP by Zubay and CRP by Pastan’s group. We will use the name CAP to refer to this protein and crp as the gene. CAP mechanism: Mutation Discovery: Zubay’s team found mutations in the lac promoter preventing CAP and cAMP from boosting lac transcription. Binding Site Location: Research pinpointed the CAP-cAMP binding site upstream of the lac promoter. CAP-cAMP Complex Formation: cAMP modifies CAP’s shape, increasing its affinity for the binding site. Open Promoter Complex Assistance: The CAP-cAMP complex helps RNA polymerase to form an open promoter complex, aiding transcription initiation. Role in Transcription: The complex aids in efficient lac operon transcription, helping the cell adapt to nutritional changes. In this process, the CAP-cAMP complex facilitates the initiation of transcription in response to environmental cues, enhancing the cell’s adaptability. Regulation: many layers Positive Reg: alpha-subunit of RNAP DNA bending Weak promoters CAP: Catabolic activator protein repressor responsible to low level of Lactose so it wound transcript when Lactose is low CAP responsible to the low level of Glu and help the transcription When Glu is low and lactose is high, the repressor is cleared and CAP is on. The transcription is started. CAP is a receptor to bind the cAMP. cAMP-CAP complex contribute the activation of the gene expression. CAP Binding Induces DNA Bending Figure 10.27 CAP bends DNA &gt;90° around the center of symmetry. Study Focus: Investigation of the DNA bending effect due to CAP–cAMP binding using electrophoresis. Method: Prepared equal length DNA fragments of the lac operon with varied CAP-binding site positions. Bound CAP–cAMP to each fragment. Performed electrophoresis to observe the migration rates of the DNA-protein complexes. Findings: DNA fragments exhibited different migration rates, indicating DNA bending. The degree of bending was estimated to be around 90 degrees, aligning reasonably with the 100 degrees found in later x-ray crystallography studies. Implication: The observed DNA bending is believed to facilitate optimal interactions between proteins and DNA in the complex. CAP-cAMP Binding Functionally Similar to Up Element P182; Figure 7.19 Study Focus: Importance of interaction between CAP and RNA polymerase’s aCTD in transcription stimulation. Experiment Details: Used RNA polymerases with both normal and truncated a-subunits to transcribe cloned lac operons in vitro. Findings: Truncated a-subunits could function like wild-type in absence of CAP-cAMP. Truncated a-subunits weren’t stimulated by CAP-cAMP, indicating the necessity of aCTD for CAP-cAMP stimulation. Hypothesis: CAP-cAMP dimer, binding to its activator site, interacts with aCTD, enhancing polymerase’s affinity for the promoter, similar to aCTD’s role with UP elements. CAP promoters 3 Classes of CAP Regulated Promoters Unknown Attribute Class I Class II Class III Activation Requires only CAP Requires only CAP Requires CAP and additional regulators CAP/CRP Binding Site Upstream of the promoter Overlaps the promoter, replacing -35 region Variable, typically &gt;90 bp upstream Prototype LacP1 GalP1 None Location (from start point) Centered 61.5 bp upstream Centered 41.5 bp upstream More than 90 bp upstream Examples - - AraBAD, malK promoter CAP Operators Display Periodicity: The greatest activation was seen at distances of -41.5 and -61.5 which correspond exactly to the spacings observed in CLASS II and CLASS I CRP-activated promoters, respectively. DNA Bending as a Regulatory Mechanism Illustrate Description - Promoter bashing of a hypothetical two-region promoter. The promoter is cloned upstream of the lacZ reporter gene. Point mutations that inactivate each region are made (the red Xs) and the region is cloned onto a plasmid and inserted into E. coli cells, grown up, and has the presence of reporter measured. The binding of Protein B in this example is necessary for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription.- In a laboratory setting, it may not be known that the promoter consists of two regions – single mutations can be made along the promoter, the promoter can be sequenced, and the levels of reporter assayed to find boundaries for each region. © wiki araBAD Operon araBAD encodes enzymes responsible for arabinose breakdown Operon is catabolite repressed, and thus requires CAP.cAMP for activation of transcription Activation also requires the complex of AraC. arabinose as an activator Explains why araBAD is only transcribed in the presence of arabinose Components: araO2: Far upstream binding site for AraC. araO1: Located between positions -106 and -144, another binding site for AraC. araI: Divided into araI1 (-56 to -78) and araI2 (-35 to -51), each can bind one monomer of AraC. araA-D: Four genes in the ara operon where araB, araA, and araD are for arabinose metabolizing enzymes and araC is for encoding the control protein AraC. araPBAD: Promoter for rightward transcription of araB, A, and D. araPC: Promoter for leftward transcription of araC. States: Without Arabinose (Repressed State): AraC binds to araO2 and araI1. Causes DNA looping between the binding sites, repressing the operon. With Arabinose (Derepressed State): Arabinose alters AraC conformation. AraC binds to araI1 and araI2, breaking the repression loop. The operon is derepressed. Positive Control: Involves CAP and cAMP. They bind to a site upstream of the araBAD promoter. DNA looping facilitates CAP’s contact with polymerase, enhancing its binding to the promoter, thereby stimulating transcription. Figures: Figure 7.21a: Illustrates the three binding sites of AraC. Figure 7.21b: Shows the repression loop in the absence of arabinose. Figure 7.21c: Depicts the derepressed state with the presence of arabinose and how CAP-cAMP complex influences transcription. This structure helps in detailing the different components involved and the states of the ara operon based on the presence or absence of arabinose, along with the role of CAP and cAMP in its regulation. It also mentions the figures that visualize these processes. Arabinose Metabolism System Promoter Bashing Identified Two Operator Sites for Repression DNA Bending Requires both araO2 and araI Sites How can araO2 control transcription from a promoter over 250 bp downstream? The most reasonable explanation is that the DNA in between these remote sites (the operator and the promoter) loops out as illustrated in Sure! Here is a summarized version of the passage in note form: P184; Figure 7.22 Experiment setup: Objective: Verify AraC-induced DNA loop formation in the ara operon in the absence of arabinose. Materials: 404-bp supercoiled minicircle DNA containing araO2 and araI sites, 160 bp apart. AraC protein. Method: Electrophoresis to measure DNA loop formation by monitoring changes in electrophoretic mobility. Findings: AraC induces loop formation: Evidence: A new high-mobility band observed upon addition of AraC, indicating looped minicircle (Figure 7.22, compare lanes 1 and 2). Loop stability depends on both araO2 and araI: Tested using: Wild-type minicircle. Minicircle with mutant araO2. Minicircle with mutations in both araI sites. Results: Wild-type: Half-time of dissociation ~100 min (50% conversion to unlooped form in 90 min, lanes 3-5). araO2 mutant: Loop broke in &lt;1 min, indicating a crucial role in loop maintenance (lanes 7 and 8). araI mutant: Half-time of loop breakage &lt;10 min, underscoring its role in loop stability. Conclusion: AraC can induce DNA looping at the ara operon in the absence of arabinose. Both araO2 and araI sites are vital for loop stability; mutations in either site destabilize the loop significantly, showcasing their roles in the AraC-mediated DNA looping mechanism. Spacing is Important AraC Binding to araO2 is Disrupted by Arabinose Binding &amp; Regulation of araPBAD P184; Figure 7.21 Experiment Setup: Objective: Understand the effect of arabinose on the AraC-induced DNA loop and elucidate the role of araI2 in AraC binding. Materials: Looped minicircles (404-bp supercoiled DNA with araO2 and araI sites). Arabinose. AraC protein. Methods: Electrophoresis to observe the influence of arabinose on loop stability. Methylation interference to study AraC contacts with araI sites in different states. Findings: Arabinose breaks the repression loop: Evidence: Disappearance of the looped DNA band upon adding arabinose before electrophoresis (refer to Figure 7.23). Reformation of broken loop: Conditions: Removal of arabinose allowed the broken loop to re-form, illustrating reversible control mediated by arabinose. AraC’s contact shifts from araO2 to araI2: Evidence: Methylation interference: AraC contacts araI1 but not araI2 in the looped state. Two araI1 bases were lightly methylated in looped DNA and heavily methylated in unlooped DNA, indicating crucial roles in looping. Mutation study: AraI2 mutations didn’t affect AraC binding in looped state but significantly influenced it in the unlooped state, highlighting its role in AraC binding post-loop breakage. Conclusion: Arabinose disrupts the AraC-induced DNA loop by altering AraC’s affinity for binding sites: it loses affinity for araO2 and gains affinity for araI2, a dynamic regulatory mechanism controlling the ara operon (depicted in Figure 7.21b and c). The role of araI2 is crucial in AraC binding in the unlooped state, facilitating the reformation of the loop upon arabinose removal. AraC autoregulates its Own Expression Molecular Biology; Weaver, Robert: Fifth edition Background: araO1’s function: Not involved in the repression of araBAD transcription. Location: Positioned to control the transcription of the araC gene (refer to Figure 7.24). Autoregulation Mechanism: Transcription Direction: The araC gene is transcribed leftward from the Pc promoter. Binding to araO1: As AraC levels increase, it binds to araO1. Inhibition of Transcription: The binding of AraC to araO1 inhibits further leftward transcription from Pc. Control of AraC Levels: The process prevents excessive accumulation of AraC, ensuring self-regulation of its synthesis levels. Conclusion: Autoregulation: The mechanism through which AraC controls its own synthesis by inhibiting transcription upon binding to araO1 is termed autoregulation. Regulatory Balance: This autoregulation helps maintain a balance in AraC levels, avoiding its overproduction and ensuring optimal functioning of the operon regulatory system.- Positive promoter elements Lactose operon promoter: -35 and -10 sequences are the two binding site of the CRP-cAMP. One of them are mutated, the binding still performed. But simultaneous mutation would decrease the expression level. CAP is a universal transcription promoter CAP is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein CAP responds to cAMP levels in the cell. it binds a dimer cAMP-CAP binding is required for high expression of the lac operon-- conserves the cells energy.

Notes The cohesive termini and the specific structure of the capsid play crucial roles in the bacteriophage’s ability to infect and integrate into the host genome. Understanding the precise infection mechanism can offer insights into bacterial immunity and potential applications in bacterial genetics research. Life Choice Depends on Genetic Switch 1. Lytic Mode Initial Phase: DNA Entry: Phage DNA enters the host cell. Transcription: Host RNA polymerase transcribes phage DNA. Translation: Phage mRNAs are translated to produce phage proteins. Replication Phase: DNA Replication: Phage DNA replicates. Assembly: New phages are assembled from DNA and protein components. Final Phase: Lysis: The host cell undergoes lysis, releasing progeny phages. Result: The host cell is killed. 2. Lysogenic Mode Initial Phase: DNA Entry: Phage DNA enters the cell. Early Gene Expression: Early genes are transcribed and translated. Repressor Role: λ Repressor (CI) Appearance: A 27-kD phage protein appears. Binding: CI binds to two phage operator regions. Effect: It shuts down transcription of all phage genes except for cI (gene coding for λ repressor). Integration Phase: Integration: Phage DNA integrates into the host genome. Lysogen Formation: The host with integrated phage DNA is termed a lysogen. Prophage: The integrated DNA is referred to as a prophage. Maintenance Phase: Reproduction: The phage DNA replicates alongside host DNA. Advantage: Allows the phage to multiply without creating new phage particles, giving it a “free ride.” Induction Phase (Conditional): Trigger: Exposure to mutagenic chemicals or radiation. Effect: The lysogenic cycle can be broken, shifting the phage into the lytic phase. Notes λ Phage Characteristics: It is a temperate phage, meaning it can follow both lytic and lysogenic paths. Versatility: λ phage showcases more versatility compared to virulent phages like T2, T4, T7, and SPO1, which always follow the lytic path. Lysogenic Stability: The lysogenic state can be stable indefinitely, beneficial for the phage as it ensures its survival and replication without killing the host. λ Genome is Organized By Function © bx.psu.edu HEAD &amp; TAIL Region (left side of the RECOMBINATION Region) Structure: Encodes for the structural proteins constituting the phage’s capsid. Terminase Enzyme: Required for processing rolling circle multimers into unit genome-length pieces during DNA packaging. RECOMBINATION Region Genes: Int: Necessary for the integration of the phage into the bacterial host chromosome during lysogenic growth. Xis: Facilitates the excision of the phage from the host chromosome during induction. Others: A variety of other genes facilitating integration and excision processes. REGULATION Region Immunity Region: Involved in the phage’s self-immunity processes. Switch Control: Houses genes controlling the switch between lysogenic and lytic growth. Q Antiterminator Protein: Part of the regulatory mechanism. Anti-Q RNA: Works alongside the Q protein in regulation. PR’: Constitutes a secondary regulation region, working in conjunction with Q protein and Anti-Q RNA. REPLICATION Region Genes: O: Replication protein gene. P: Another gene involved in replication. Origin of Replication: The starting point for the DNA replication process. LYSIS Region Gene Count: Contains four genes. Function: The genes in this region are generally involved in the lysis of the host cell, facilitating the release of new phage particles. Note Different Regions: Each region in the bacteriophage genome is designated for a different function, playing a crucial role in the phage’s life cycle, either helping in its replication, regulation of its life cycle, or in the processes leading to the integration into or excision from the host genome. λ Inserts into the Host Genome by Recombination λ has 7 Promoters PR expresses the replication genes as well as the anti-repressor, Cro, the transcriptional activator cII, and the anti-terminator, Q protein. PL expresses the recombination genes as well as the anti-terminator, N, and the cIII protein. PR’ expresses the lysis proteins, and the head and tail proteins. PRE expresses the repressor gene, cI, to establish lysogeny. PRM expresses the repressor gene, cI, to maintain lysogeny. PI expresses the int gene to synthesize the Integrase protein. PaQ drives synthesis of a short anti-sense RNA which blocks translation of Q gene mRNA. Protein Expression is Stage Dependent Event l Gene Expressed Comment Initial infection Cro, N Only N and Cro are synthesized until the decision point is reached Lytic pathway Cro, N, Q, late genes Cro predominates at operators, N and Q are antiterminators Lysogenic pathway cI, cII, cIII, int cII and cIII collaborate to establish cI synthesis; after genome integration, only cI is expressed during maintenance of lysogeny. Consequences of Early Gene Expression Cro repressor mRNA made from PR and translated. N antiterminator mRNA made from PL and translated. Allows transcription and translation of cII and cIII. cII/cIII proteins activate PRE, causing transcription of cI Concentrations of cI and Cro proteins build up Initial Events Molecular Decision-Making: Choice between Lysis &amp; Lysogeny Determined by relative concentrations of cI and Cro, which act oppositely on PRM the promoter for Repressor Maintenance PRM requires cI protein, therefore not active just after infection. Inhibited by Cro. Cro lower affinity for PRM but is made earlier. Cro binds same operator sites as cI, but not as efficiently or stably. At low levels, will slow down, but not stop expression of N , cIII (PL) or cII, P, Q (PR). At high levels, cII and cIII are prevented from being transcribed, so no cI. λ Immunity Region © genes.atspace.org Lysogeny Unknown N is an Anti-Terminator Molecular Biology; Weaver, Robert: Fifth edition; P206 P207; Figure 8.14 Physical and Functional Layout Location: Situated downstream of the PL promoter and its respective operator, OL. Nut Site: Contains specific sequences, box A and box B, which play crucial roles in the functioning of the N protein. Functionality in the Absence of N Protein Transcription Start: Commences at the PL promoter. Transcription Termination: Occurs at a terminator site situated downstream of the N gene. The RNA polymerase releases the N mRNA here. Functionality in the Presence of N Protein N Protein Synthesis: Once the N gene has been transcribed, the N protein materializes. Binding to Nut Site: The N protein binds to the nut site on the transcript. Alteration of RNA Polymerase: The N protein collaborates with a complex of host proteins, altering the RNA polymerase to overlook the terminator site and proceed with transcription into the delayed early genes. Involvement of Host Proteins Nus Proteins: These include NusA, NusB, and NusG, which have roles in both the phage and host cell processes. Ribosomal S10 Protein: Participates in protein synthesis in the host cell. Antitermination: N and NusA can facilitate antitermination in close proximity to the nut site, forming a short-range antitermination complex with the RNA polymerase. Processive Antitermination Long-Range Effect: In natural circumstances, antitermination occurs hundreds of base pairs downstream of nut sites, requiring the involvement of all Nus proteins and S10 for stability. Persistent Complex: A stable complex is formed, continuing until reaching the terminator. Nut Site Interaction RNA Interaction: Rather than interacting with the nut site itself, the complex interacts with its transcript. RNA-binding Domain: The region in N essential for nut recognition features an arginine-rich domain akin to RNA-binding domains. Protection from RNase: A full assembly of the five proteins in the complex shields both boxes A and B from RNase attacks. RNA Loop Formation Sustained Signal: The RNA between the nut site transcript and the RNA polymerase forms a loop, maintaining the association of N with both, thus providing a continuous signal to the polymerase until it reaches the terminator. Evidence: Experiments have indicated that alterations in the RNA polymerase b-subunit gene can obstruct N-mediated antitermination, suggesting a potential association between the RNA polymerase, N, and the nut site transcript during transcription. Conclusion The gene N encodes for the N protein which plays a pivotal role in the antitermination process during the phage lifecycle. It acts by binding to the nut site of the transcript and altering RNA polymerase activity, facilitating transcription beyond the terminator site. This mechanism leverages both short-range and processive antitermination, guided by a complex interplay of different proteins and the intricate structure of the nut site and its transcript. The stability and sustained activity of this system are central to its function, maintaining a persistent signal through RNA loop formations that guide the RNA polymerase over substantial distances. N Prevents Stem-loop Formation P208; Figure 8.15 Background Initial Hypothesis: N restricts the RNA polymerase pausing vital for termination. Research by Gusarov and Nudler (2001): Contradicted the initial hypothesis, highlighting that N doesn’t significantly affect pausing but instead influences the formation of the terminator hairpin. Mechanism N Binding to RNA: N binds to the portion of RNA supposed to form the upstream part of the terminator hairpin, thereby slowing down its formation. Preventing Hairpin Formation: Without the hairpin structure, the termination process cannot proceed, a mechanism somewhat similar to overriding transcription attenuation seen in the trp operon. Role of NusA Interaction with Elongation Complex (EC): As EC synthesizes a string of U’s, it pauses after adding the seventh nucleotide, positioning the potential upstream part of the hairpin to bind to the RNA polymerase’s upstream binding site (UBS). Time Constraint: The pause lasts for about 2 seconds, within which the hairpin should form to ensure termination; otherwise, the polymerase progresses without terminating. Stimulation of Termination: NusA weakens the connection between the potential upstream part of the hairpin and the UBS, encouraging quick hairpin formation and subsequently promoting termination. Comprehensive Model (Gusarov and Nudler, 2001) Dual Binding: Both N and NusA bind to the RNA segment meant to form the upstream part of the hairpin. Blocking Hairpin Formation: By binding to the RNA segment, N prevents the quick formation of the hairpin. NusA’s Role: While connected to N, NusA also associates with the RNA segment, further slowing down the hairpin formation. Outcome: Due to the hindered hairpin formation, RNA polymerase moves forward without engaging in the termination process. Conclusion N prevents termination not by limiting RNA polymerase pausing but by binding to the RNA segment that is crucial for forming the terminator hairpin, consequently slowing down its formation. NusA plays a dual role, both facilitating and slowing down hairpin formation depending on its interactions with either the RNA or N. The intricate interaction between N, NusA, and the RNA orchestrates whether the termination proceeds or not. PL source: wiki In addition to N, the early transcript of PL codes for: cIII required to protect the activator protein, cII Xis normally required for excision of a prophage Int normally required for integration of a prophage. Background Context: Early lytic growth phase of bacteriophages. Concerned Molecules: Xis and Int proteins. Primary Regulator: N protein. Mechanism Role of N Protein: Transcriptional Impact: Influences RNA polymerase to bypass the tI transcription terminator and continue transcription through the sib region. Attachment: Remains attached to the ternary transcription complex. Sib Region: Characteristic: Houses the signal for an RNase III processing site. Effect on mRNA: Transcripts passing through this region undergo structural changes to form a hairpin configuration. Action of RNase III: Recognition: Identifies the hairpin structure in the transcripts. Cleavage: Splits the transcript at the identified site, leaving free 3’ ends. Exonuclease Activity: Degradation: Enzymes present in the cell degrade the free 3’ ends further. Impact on Xis and Int: The coding regions for Xis and Int largely get destroyed before translation can occur, reducing their expression significantly. Retroregulation Definition: A regulatory mechanism where the stability and translatability of mRNA are controlled post-transcriptionally, affecting the subsequent expression of certain genes (in this case, Xis and Int). Outcome in the Context: Ensures limited expression of Xis and Int during the early lytic growth phase, maintaining control over the developmental pathway of the bacteriophage through intricate regulation at the RNA level. Conclusion Efficiency in Regulation: Retroregulation efficiently controls the expression of Xis and Int proteins during early lytic growth through a series of RNA modifications and processing, preventing their significant expression and translation during this phase. Regulatory Network: The process involves a network of actions including the N protein’s influence on RNA polymerase, hairpin formation guided by the sib region signal, RNase III-mediated cleavage, and exonuclease-induced degradation, demonstrating a tight regulatory mechanism at work during bacteriophage development. cIII Inhibits Proteolysis of cII cII half-life alone is &lt; 1min but with cIII it is ~ 5 min pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/09/07/LearnNotes/UIUC-AdMC-6/"},{"title":"Acoustics","text":"Acoustics waveform, phase, amplitude (usually expressed in log units known as decibels, abbreviated dB), and frequency. For human listeners, the amplitude and frequency of a sound pressure change at the ear roughly correspond to loudness and pitch, respectively.

Link to Autism: Leading known genetic cause of autism. Sensory Processing in FXS General Characteristics: Abnormal sensory processing, particularly sensory hypersensitivity. Manifestations: Auditory, tactile, or visual defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical and behavioral studies show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention. Visuospatial Impairments: Significant deficits observed. Noted problems in processing texture-defined motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequences, and maintaining dynamic object identity during occlusion. Animal Models: Fmr1 KO Rodents General: Fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene knockout (KO) rodents used as FXS models. Findings: Seizures. Abnormal visual-evoked responses. Auditory hypersensitivity. Altered acoustic startle responses. Abnormal processing in the auditory system. Tactile Symptoms: Individuals with FXS show tactile defensiveness. Fmr1 KO mice have impaired tactile stimulation frequency encoding and larger receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex. Review Focus: Discusses clinical, functional, and structural studies on sensory processing deficits in FXS across: Auditory. (We only focus on Auditory in this note) Visual. Somatosensory domains. Significance of Animal Models: Observations in FXS humans and Fmr1 KO rodents are similar, suggesting conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across species. Offers a translational platform to develop biomarkers and understand underlying mechanisms. Conclusion: Emphasizes the value of pre-clinical studies in animal models of FXS. Belief: Understanding mechanisms in basic sensory processing circuits/behaviors can boost the search for new therapeutic approaches in FXS. Introduction Prevalence and Impact: intellectual disability, Link to Autism: One of the leading genetic causes. Statistics: Affects 1 in 4,000 boys and 1 in 8,000 girls. Genetic Origin: Gene Impacted: Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Causes: Silencing, Deletion, Loss-of-function mutation. Consequences: Results in the non-expression or nonfunctionality of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). About FMRP: Type: A messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein. Functions: Regulates several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including: Nuclear export. Transport to synaptic terminals. Activity-dependent ribosome stalling. Protein translation. FMRP’s Role in Synaptic Function and Translation Regulation Translation Regulation: FMRP regulates the translation of mRNAs at synapses. Some of these mRNAs encode proteins linked to synaptic plasticity. Impact of Absence of FMRP: Results in dysregulation of protein translation and increased protein synthesis. This may contribute to altered signaling of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). This altered signaling may lead to exaggerated long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus. Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9): FMRP negatively regulates MMP-9 translation in neurons because MMP-9 levels are elevated in FXS. mGluR5 and MMP-9 potentially mediate changes in synaptic functions. They might signal through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways to amplify cap-dependent translation. Recent Data on FMRP: Suggests that FMRP might directly regulate PI3K and mTORC1 signaling. This regulation could occur through other signaling proteins like phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase enhancer, phosphatase and tensin homolog, neurofibromin 1, and tuberous sclerosis 2. FMRP Targets: All three isoforms of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 and 2. Argonaute proteins. Dicer. Dysregulation of these targets might contribute to enhanced neuronal translation in FXS. Role of Dysregulated Pathways and FMRP in Dendritic Spine Morphology and Neurophysiology Dysregulated Pathways in FXS: Dysregulated PI3K/mTOR signaling. Enhanced mGluR5-dependent LTD. Increased MMP-9 activity. Reduced activity of the voltage and $Ca^{2+}$ activated ( K^+ ) (BKCa or BK) channel. These might contribute to the immature dendritic spine morphology in rodent models of FXS. FMRP’s Role in Mice: Might regulate neuronal branching. Regulates dendritic spine development. Clinical Studies in Humans: Alterations observed in dendritic spine number and morphology in the cortex of FXS humans. A notable prevalence of immature dendritic spines. Dendritic abnormalities are consistent anatomical features linked with intellectual disability. FMRP’s Predominant Activity: Mainly related to the regulation of synaptic functions. Yet, there’s limited knowledge about: How synaptic alterations due to the absence of FMRP lead to neurophysiological and behavioral deficits in humans with FXS. The reason why abnormal dendritic spine development alone doesn’t explain the increased cortical excitability seen in FXS. Using auditory reaction time to measure loudness growth in rats Abstract Introduction: Auditory Reaction Time (RT): Established as a reliable proxy for loudness perception in humans. Reaction Time-Intensity (RT-I) Functions: Effectively mirror equal loudness contours in humans. Easier to obtain than equal loudness judgments, particularly in animal subjects. Factors Affecting Loudness Estimation: Sound Intensity: Primary factor. Other Acoustic Factors: Stimulus duration. Bandwidth. Background Noise Effect: Simulates loudness recruitment. Rapid loudness growth near threshold, but stabilizes at suprathreshold levels. Study Objectives: Examine if RT-I functions can reliably measure loudness growth in rats. Obtain auditory RTs across varying: Stimulus intensities. Durations. Bandwidths. Experiments conducted in both quiet conditions and amidst background/masking noise. Findings: Reaction time patterns across different stimulus parameters: Repeated consistently over several months in rats. Generally align with human loudness perceptual data. Significance: Results lay foundational understanding for upcoming studies on loudness perception in animal models. Potential to explore loudness perceptual disorders in animals. Introduction Exploring Loudness Perception Beyond Traditional Methods Standard Tool: Pure Tone Audiogram: Essential for hearing research but limited in scope. Loudness Perception: Beyond hearing threshold, loudness perception for louder sounds is crucial. Clinical Metrics: Uses scales like ULL and LDL where listeners rate discomfort from various sound intensities. Human Psychophysical Studies: Equal loudness contours: Listeners compare sound loudness to a standard tone, a labor-intensive method. Measuring Loudness Perception in Animals Traditional Measures: LDLs and equal loudness contours: Useful for humans but impractical for animals. Auditory Reaction Time (RT): Used as an indirect metric of loudness in animals. In humans, a faster RT correlates with perceived loudness. Advantages of RT: Reliable for both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Easier to obtain than traditional measures, making it useful for various species. Certainly! I’ll further condense and clarify the content: Loudness Perception Factors in Humans Intensity: Main determinant, but not the sole factor. Duration: Longer sounds (up to 300 ms) seem louder. Bandwidth: Wider bandwidths make sounds feel louder. Background Noise: Can mimic “loudness recruitment”, where sounds just above threshold feel quiet but get rapidly louder. Evaluating Reaction Time-Intensity (RT-I) Functions in Rats Objective: Check if RT-I in rats matches human patterns of perceived loudness. Method: Measured auditory RTs in rats for various: Intensities Durations Bandwidths Conducted in quiet and with background noise. Expectations: If rats and humans perceive loudness similarly: RTs should decrease as intensity, duration, and bandwidth increase. RTs should rise near the hearing threshold when background noise is present. Aims and Challenges in Developing an Animal Behavioral Model for Loudness Perceptual Disorders Primary Goal: Develop a behavioral model in animals to study loudness perceptual disorders, specifically loudness recruitment and hyperacusis. Challenges: Accounting for effects of drug or noise on hearing. E.g., High-dose salicylate can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and possibly hyperacusis. Noise often leads to hearing loss, loudness recruitment, and potentially tinnitus and hyperacusis in some listeners. A successful model should distinguish: Loudness recruitment from hyperacusis. Hyperacusis from tinnitus. Tinnitus-like Percept Study: Effect of broadband noise vs. tonal masker on RTs was studied. Goal: Understand the influence of a “tinnitus-like” percept on loudness growth. Hypothesis: Tinnitus-like 16 kHz masker won’t affect RT-I functions for 4 kHz tones but might impact the loudness growth of 16 kHz tones. Stability of RTs in Rats: Beyond comparing rat RT-I functions to humans, the study aimed to test RT stability over time. This is crucial as animal psychoacoustic studies span weeks or months. A consistent loudness perception metric is needed, especially when no experimental manipulations are applied. Result Impact of Stimulus Duration on Auditory Reaction Time (RT) Experiment Setup: Reaction time-intensity (RT-I) functions were measured for broadband noise bursts (BBN) across three durations: 20 ms, 100 ms, and 300 ms. Main Findings: RTs for BBN decreased with rising stimulus intensity for all tested durations. Rats had quicker RTs (i.e., reacted faster) with longer stimulus durations. No significant interaction found between sound level and stimulus duration. Results imply rats perceived longer sounds as louder, similar to human perception. Detailed Results: RTs for 300 ms BBN were significantly faster than for 100 ms and 20 ms BBN. Significant differences were observed: Between 20 ms and 300 ms BBN across all sound levels. Between 100 ms and 300 ms BBN at specific dB levels: 40, 50, 60, and 80 dB SPL. Impact of Stimulus Bandwidth on Auditory Reaction Time (RT) in Rats Hypothesis: Wider band stimuli would sound louder (and thus induce faster RTs in rats) compared to narrower band or pure tone stimuli, based on human data. Key Findings: Rats reacted faster to stimuli with increased bandwidth, aligning with the hypothesis that wideband stimuli sound louder. Detailed Observations: RTs for Broadband Noise Bursts (BBN) were faster than for 16 kHz pure tones at most sound levels, excluding 30 dB SPL. RTs for BBN were also faster compared to 16–20 kHz Narrow Band Noise (NBN) for specific dB levels: 30, 40, 50, and 60 dB SPL. Conclusion: Just as with duration, these results indicate that RT is a reliable metric for loudness perception in rats, mirroring known human data on loudness perceptions of different bandwidth sounds. Effects of Background Noise on Loudness Perception in Rats Experiment Setup: Measured RT-I functions for Broadband Noise Bursts (BBN) in quiet and with low-level background noise (2-20 kHz, 60 dB SPL). Main Findings: In the presence of background noise, rats had: Slower RTs for lower intensity sounds. Regular RTs for higher intensity sounds. These patterns suggest the rats experienced recruitment-like perceptions in noise. As intensity increased just above threshold, RT decrease was sharper in noise than in quiet, aligning with loudness recruitment patterns. Background Noise Effects: Significant effects found on RTs for lower intensity stimuli when compared to quiet conditions. In particular, differences were noted at 30, 40, and 50 dB SPL BBN levels. This indicates that, like humans, rats experience a recruitment-like loudness growth in the presence of background noise. Effects of 16 kHz Masker: No recruitment-like effects on RTs for 4 kHz tones. Rats reacted slightly faster at 40 and 50 dB SPL tones with the 16 kHz masker. However, the effect might be due to task performance variability. For 16 kHz tones, the masker had a significant effect, especially at 60 dB SPL. This suggests that animals with tinnitus might show recruitment-like behaviors for sounds close to the tinnitus frequency. Discussion RT-I functions in rats align with established human loudness perception research, suggesting they’re a valid measure of rat loudness growth. Their consistency over four months indicates the RT-I approach reliably reflects loudness perception in rats. Key Findings on Noise Exposure and Hearing Loudness Recruitment: Noise and drugs can cause hearing loss. This loss can lead to “loudness recruitment,” where soft sounds seem quickly loud, but this doesn’t affect louder sounds. Using Rats to Understand Loudness: In our tests, rats exposed to background noise showed symptoms similar to loudness recruitment. Hyperacusis: This is when everyday sounds seem too loud. Certain studies, including ours, used reaction times to detect hyperacusis in animals. Our tests found that a high aspirin dose made rats more sensitive to certain sound levels. Noise Exposure’s Role: Extended noise exposure in rats caused both loudness recruitment and hyperacusis-like behaviors. Reaction Time-Intensity (RT-I) as a Model for Loudness Growth: Loudness Growth in Animals: Our RT-I conditioning model effectively maps loudness growth in animals. It can predict how noise or drug exposure influences loudness perception. Hyperacusis vs. Loudness Recruitment: Hyperacusis: Faster reaction times at moderate-high sound intensities. Loudness Recruitment: Regular reaction times at these intensities. Differentiating between tinnitus and hyperacusis is crucial. Studying Tinnitus: Prior studies on tinnitus using RT-I functions lacked comprehensive results. In our experiment, using a “tinnitus-like” background showed recruitment-like loudness growth for tones at tinnitus pitch. Other tones remained unaffected. Hyperacusis showed a different pattern than tinnitus. Thus, RT-I functions can potentially distinguish between the two. However, the overlap of tinnitus with hearing loss complicates this distinction. Conclusion and Future Directions: Auditory reaction time mirrors loudness perception both in rats and humans. RT-I functions can screen for hearing disorders in rats post noise/drug exposure. Our goal is to expand this model, compare it with human loudness contours, and integrate neural and biochemical measures in future studies. Testing the Central Gain Model: Loudness Growth Correlates with Central Auditory Gain Enhancement in a Rodent Model of Hyperacusis Abstract Central Gain Model of Hyperacusis Theory: Auditory input ↓ → Neuronal gain ↑ → Over-amplification &amp; loudness ↑. Study Objective Link: Sound-evoked activity changes ↔ Loudness perceptual alterations. Methodology Operant Conditioning Task: Measure: Loudness via auditory stimuli reaction time. Chronic Electrophysiological Recordings: Locations: Auditory cortex &amp; inferior colliculus (awake animals). Goal: Daily loudness perception ↔ Neurophysiological sound encoding. Salicylate-induced Model Purpose: Validate the paradigm. Effects of high sodium salicylate doses: Temporary hearing loss. Neural hyperactivity. Auditory disruptions (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis). Findings Salicylate effects: Alters: Loudness growth &amp; Evoked response-intensity. Results: Consistent with: Temporary hearing loss &amp; hyperacusis. Correlation: Loudness growth ↔ Sound-evoked activity (individual animals). Conclusion Strong support: Central gain model of hyperacusis. Value: Experimental design for within-subject comparison. Introduction part 1 Hyperacusis Definition: Auditory disorder where moderate sounds → intolerably loud/painful. Type: Common with sensorineural hearing loss. Central Gain Model (CGM) Concept: Maladaptive response in auditory system due to hearing loss. Mechanism: Central auditory system adjusts for hearing sensitivity. Dysregulation &amp; central auditory pathway over-amplification → normal sounds perceived as excessively loud. Support: Accounts for major hyperacusis features. Strong evidence backing. Validation Need: Relate central gain changes &amp; loudness perception. Human Imaging Findings: Hyperacusis patients → increased sound-evoked activity. Limitation: Can’t link neurophysiological changes &amp; hyperacusis development. Animal Models Advantage: Detailed hyperacusis examination. Findings: Hearing loss (due to noise/drugs) → central gain increase. Limitation: Between-group comparisons. Acute measurements from anesthetized subjects. → Focus on specific auditory areas. Few studies link central gain &amp; loudness. part 2 Challenges in Hyperacusis Study Direct Relationship Needs: Objective loudness perception indicators. Indicators should reflect both hearing loss &amp; hyperacusis in single animals. Inter-subject Variability: Hearing loss is a hyperacusis trigger but not a guaranteed outcome. Not all animals develop hyperacusis even under similar conditions. Loudness Perception Indicator: RT-I RT-I: Measures loudness growth via subject’s reaction time (RT) to varied sound intensities. Closely linked with human loudness growth &amp; equal loudness contours. Usage: Reflects loudness recruitment in hearing impaired humans &amp; animals. Captures hyperacusis-like changes (example: rats treated with sodium salicylate). Animal Models &amp; Hyperacusis Variability Need: Relate neural hyperactivity with hyperacusis-like behavior in each animal. Our Approach: Combine psychophysical &amp; electrophysiological methods. Track changes in both loudness perception &amp; sound-evoked activity longitudinally. Methodology Chronic Implants: Locations: Auditory cortex (AC) &amp; inferior colliculus (IC). Purpose: Monitor sound-evoked activity in awake animals &amp; avoid anesthesia issues. Benefit: Directly link sound encoding with daily loudness growth assessment per animal. Validation of Combined Approach Test: Effect of salicylate on RT-I &amp; neural activity in the same animals. Findings: Salicylate-induced changes in RT-I &amp; sound-evoked activity coexist in individual animals. Supports the central gain model. Validates the combined behavioral-electrophysiological paradigm. Result Stable behavioral and electrophysiological measures of loudness growth Experiment Overview Tested Animals: 8 rats. Procedure: Go/No-go operant conditioning paradigm. Electrodes chronically implanted in primary AC &amp; central nucleus of the IC. Observations LFP Tuning Curves: Well-tuned for frequency. AC &amp; IC electrodes matched for characteristic frequency in each hemisphere. Baseline RT-I &amp; LFP I/O Functions (broadband noise burst 30–90 dB SPL): RTs: Decreased from ~325 ms (30 dB SPL) to ~140 ms (90 dB SPL). AC I/O Functions: Amplitude increased from ~30 mV (30 dB SPL) to ~70 mV (90 dB SPL). IC I/O Functions: Amplitude grew from ~40 mV (30 dB SPL) to ~125 mV (90 dB SPL). Consistency: No significant differences observed across baseline sessions in RT-I, AC, or IC I/O functions. Conclusion: Behavioral &amp; electrophysiological responses are stable without any explicit manipulation. Salicylate-induced hyperacusis and hyperactivity Post-Baseline Testing with Sodium Salicylate (SS) Treatment Procedure: Animals received 200 mg/kg SS injection (i.p.). Assessments made 2 hours post-SS and again after 24 hours. Data Analysis: RTs &amp; AC/IC LFP amplitudes normalized to maximum average baseline values. Observations 2 Hours Post-SS: Low-Intensity Noise Bursts (30 dB SPL): RTs → Slower than baseline. AC/IC Amplitudes → Smaller than baseline. Interpretation: Cochlear hearing loss likely from SS-mediated ototoxicity. Moderate-to-High Intensities (70-90 dB SPL): RTs → Faster than baseline → Suggests sounds perceived louder (possible hyperacusis). AC/IC Amplitudes → Larger than baseline → Indicates enhanced central gain. Observations 24 Hours Post-SS: Both behavioral and electrophysiological changes observed at 2 hours post-SS were reversed. Likely due to drug washout. Salicylate-induced gain modulation Results Analysis Based on Fig. 2A-C Observation: SS alters loudness growth &amp; LFP responses. At low intensities: Slower RTs &amp; decreased LFPs. At high intensities: Faster RTs &amp; enhanced LFPs. Result: Steeper slope of response functions → Central gain theory hallmark. Response Gain Assessment - Approach 1: Fit RT-I &amp; AC/IC LFP response functions with linear regression. Check slope changes (normalized response/dB) due to SS. 2 hours post-SS: RT, AC, IC functions → Greater slopes than baseline. 24 hours post-SS: Slopes → No significant deviation from baseline. Response Gain Assessment - Approach 2: Transform baseline RT/AC/IC response function to post-SS equivalent. Scatter plots depict change in response magnitude at each intensity post-SS. Interpretation: Below 45° line → Decreased response post-SS. Above 45° line → Increased response post-SS. Scatter Plot Analysis: Plots fitted with linear regression (2 &amp; 24 hours post-SS). Slope (R Gain) describes magnitude of gain modulation by SS: ( R \\text{ Gain} &gt; 1 ) → Enhanced response gain. ( R \\text{ Gain} &lt; 1 ) → Decreased response gain. ( R \\text{ Gain} = 1 ) → No change in response gain. Key Findings: Baseline sessions: Response gain consistent across RT-I or AC/IC LFP functions. 2 hours post-SS: Slope &gt; 1 for RT, AC, IC → Increased response gain. More robust gain increase observed in AC than IC. 24 hours post-SS: Response growth rate reverted to baseline. Within-subject relationship between RT, AC and IC gain changes Results Analysis Based on Fig. 2 &amp; 3 Salicylate’s Effects: Alters response gain for RT and LFP I/O functions. Central gain enhancement linked with altered loudness perception. Individual Animal Analysis (Fig. 3): Animal with substantial RT-I alteration post-SS also had pronounced changes in AC/IC I/O functions. Animal with modest RT-I alteration post-SS exhibited minor changes in AC/IC I/O functions. RT-I &amp; AC/IC I/O functions reverted to baseline levels 24h post-SS in both cases. Subject-by-Subject Analysis: Behavioral &amp; electrophysiological changes due to salicylate are correlated within individual animals. Majority of subjects exhibited increased response gain (R G +) post-SS. RT-I function: 7/8 animals had significant change. AC I/O function: 6/8 animals had significant increase. IC I/O function: 5/8 animals had significant change. All gain changes reverted to baseline 24h post-SS. Hypothesis Testing: Correlation found between individual AC &amp; RT-I and between individual IC &amp; RT-I response gains. AC and RT-I gain changes showed close concordance in magnitude. Distinguishing Hyperacusis from Loudness Recruitment: Increase in response gain doesn’t necessarily indicate hyperacusis. Response gain doesn’t determine if responses overshoot baseline. Changes in loudness &amp; neural activity post-SS were significantly correlated. Decreased sensitivity to low-intensity sounds post-SS linked to response changes in AC and IC. Hyperacusis-like behavior at moderate-to-high intensities more correlated with cortical than subcortical response changes. Discussion Discussion: → Objective: Link hyperacusis &amp; central gain enhancement. Methods: Psychophysical-electrophysiological approach. Stable loudness &amp; auditory-evoked functions from animals. Assessed salicylate effects on RT-I &amp; AC/IC I/O. Findings: Salicylate: Alters RT-I &amp; AC/IC I/O → Suggests hearing loss &amp; hyperacusis. Loudness &amp; sound-evoked activity affected by salicylate are correlated. Significance: Supports central gain model of hyperacusis. Within-subject comparisons valuable; inter-subject variability is a strength. Mutations causing syndromic autism define an axis of synaptic pathophysiology Abstraction Topic: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) &amp; fragile X syndrome (FXS): Genetic diseases with intellectual disability &amp; autism. Hypothesis: Cause: Mutations in genes regulating neuronal protein synthesis. Excessive protein synthesis might be a core mechanism for intellectual disability &amp; autism. Method &amp; Findings: Used: Electrophysiological &amp; biochemical assays in the hippocampus of Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/y mice. Result: Synaptic dysfunction due to mutations falls at opposite ends of a physiological spectrum. Synaptic, biochemical, cognitive defects in mutants can be corrected by modulating metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in opposite directions. Deficits vanish when mice carry both mutations. Conclusion: Optimal synaptic plasticity &amp; cognition occur within a specific range of mGluR5-mediated protein synthesis. Deviating from this range results in shared behavioural impairments. Introduction Background: &gt;1% have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 50% of them also have intellectual disability (ID). Main cause: Unknown. Some known: Genetic syndromes. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS): Caused by FMR1 gene silencing. Fmr1 knockout mouse: ↑ protein synthesis via mGluR5. Inhibiting mGluR5 corrects FXS. Hypothesis: Some ASD &amp; ID from gene mutations affecting synaptic mRNA. Altered protein synthesis common in autism &amp; ID? Study Aim: Examine: TSC mutation → same protein synthesis abnormalities as FXS? If yes, one treatment could benefit both disorders. Result TSC mutations affect synaptic function Reasons: Single-gene disorder → ASD &amp; ID symptoms like FXS. Affected gene in receptor-to-mRNA translation pathway. Valid mouse models available. Some mouse models respond to protein synthesis treatments. TSC Details: Caused by TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations. Form TSC1/2 complex. TSC1/2 inhibits Rheb → specific for mTOR in mTORC1 complex. Excessive mTORC1 → ↑ mRNA translation &amp; cell growth. TSC symptoms: Hamartoma growths due to functional allele inactivation. Some TSC neurological symptoms: Tumor growth in cortex. Other symptoms (cognitive &amp; autism): Abnormal synaptic signaling. Mouse Model: Tsc1 or Tsc2 mutants → hippocampus-dependent learning/memory deficits. No brain tumors or seizures. Used Tsc2+/- model. TSC2 mutations more severe &amp; common in humans. Tsc2+/- mice treated with mTORC1 inhibitor (rapamycin) → improved hippocampal memory. Potential drug treatment for TSC &amp; FXS. Hypothesis: TSC synaptic dysfunction → ↑ protein synthesis (due to ↑ mTORC1). mTORC1 links mGluR5 to protein synthesis. mTOR ↑ protein synthesis also in Fmr1-/y mouse (controversial). mGluR-LTD: Electrophysiological measure of local mRNA translation. Exaggerated LTD in Fmr1-/y → led to mGluR FXS theory. Study: Examine mGluR-LTD in Tsc2+/- mouse hippocampus. Protein synthesis and mGluR-LTD in Tsc2+/- mice LTD Induction: Used Gp1 mGluRs (mGluR 1 &amp; 5) activation with DHPG in hippocampal slices. Tsc2+/- mice showed deficient DHPG-induced LTD compared to WT (Fig. 1a). Similar deficit observed with patterned electrical stimulation (Fig. 1b). Tsc2+/- Synaptic Function: Basal synaptic transmission in CA1 was normal (Supplementary Fig. 1). NMDA-receptor-dependent LTD was also similar between Tsc2+/- and WT (Fig. 1c). DHPG-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (indicator of Gp1 mGluR signalling) unchanged in Tsc2+/- (Fig. 1d). Concluded: Deficit in mGluR-LTD isn’t from global synaptic or Gp1 mGluR signalling disruption. LTD Mechanisms: Two mechanisms in WT: Reduced presynaptic glutamate release probability. Reduced postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Postsynaptic change needs immediate mRNA translation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) reduced LTD in WT (Fig. 2a) but not in Tsc2+/- (Fig. 2b). Suggests: Tsc2+/- has selective loss of protein-synthesis-dependent component of LTD. Comparison with Fmr1-/y Mouse: Tsc2+/-'s electrophysiological results contrast Fmr1-/y, where mGluR-LTD is enhanced. Fmr1-/y has increased basal mRNA translation downstream of mGluR5. Tsc2+/- showed decreased [35S] methionine/cysteine protein incorporation under basal conditions (Fig. 2d). Arc Protein: Reduced Arc expression in Tsc2+/- hippocampal slices (Fig. 2e). Arc is synthesized in response to Gp1 mGluR activation and required for mGluR-LTD. Significant reduction in Arc translation in Tsc2+/- hippocampus (Fig. 2f). Indicates: mGluR-LTD deficiency in Tsc2+/- due to decreased translation of LTD-stabilizing proteins, including Arc. LTD deficit caused by excess mTOR activity Goal: Understand if the Tsc2+/- mutation’s impact on mGluR-LTD is due to unchecked mTOR activity. Key Findings: Rapamycin restored mGluR-LTD in Tsc2+/- to normal levels. This treatment didn’t affect the WT mice. The rescue in Tsc2+/- was due to restored protein synthesis. Conclusion: Uncontrolled mTOR activity in Tsc2+/- hinders the protein synthesis needed for mGluR-LTD. Effect of mGluR5-positive allosteric modulation mGluR5’s Role in Tsc2+/- Model of TSC: Background: FXS issues are fixed by lowering mGluR5 signaling. Thought of boosting mGluR5 signaling for TSC. mGluR5 PAM’s Impact: A PAM boosts mGluR-LTD in Tsc2+/- mice. This corrects the protein-dependent part of LTD. PAM (CDPPB) also fixes protein and Arc synthesis issues. Behavioral Effects: Tsc2+/- mice struggle in a fear task. mGluR5 and new protein synthesis are crucial for this. CDPPB treatment before training helps Tsc2+/- mice. Conclusion: Boosting mGluR5 might help treat TSC cognitive problems. Fmr2/y and Tsc21/2 mutations cancel each other Contrasting Effects of FXS and TSC Mutations on mGluR5 and Memory: Initial Findings: FXS and TSC mutations show opposite impacts on protein-synthesis-dependent LTD. They respond oppositely to mGluR5 treatments. Experiment with Combined Mutations: Introduced an Fmr1 deletion to Tsc2+/- background. mGluR-LTD was reduced in Tsc2+/- and increased in Fmr1-/y. Mice with both mutations showed mGluR-LTD similar to WT. Memory Impairment Comparison: Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/y have similar cognitive issues, despite opposite synaptic alterations. Both have a context discrimination memory deficit. However, double mutants don’t show this deficit, suggesting both mutations might counteract each other’s effects on behavior. Discussion LTD, Protein Synthesis, and Genetic Disorders: Context: LTD and mGluR5-related protein synthesis are significant in FXS. FXS arises from the absence of FMRP, an mRNA-binding protein inhibiting translation. In the Fmr1-/y mouse, there’s heightened protein synthesis and exaggerated LTD via an mGluR5-ERK1/2 pathway. mTOR Significance: Elevated mTOR activity suppresses protein synthesis vital for LTD in Tsc2+/- mice. Hyperphosphorylation of FMRP or increased translation of certain mRNAs might explain this suppression. Arc, crucial for mGluR5-related long-term plasticity, is under-translated in Tsc2+/- mice. mGluR-LTD differences in Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/y mice suggest distinct regulation by FMRP and TSC1/2. Potential Treatments: Rapamycin, though beneficial, has limitations due to immunosuppressive properties. mGluR5 PAMs might target synaptic mechanisms causing cognitive and behavioral issues in TSC. Implications for ASD: TSC and FXS are significant genetic risk factors for ASD and intellectual disability. While Fmr1 mutation leads to exaggerated protein synthesis and LTD, Tsc2 mutation causes the opposite. Both can be balanced out in combined mutations. This suggests that ASD’s genetic causes might produce similar effects by deviations from the norm. Therapies for one type of ASD might not work for all, emphasizing personalized treatments. Deletion of Fmr1 from Forebrain Excitatory Neurons Triggers Abnormal Cellular, EEG, and Behavioral Phenotypes in the Auditory Cortex of a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome Abstract Fragile X Syndrome and Sensory Processing Deficits: Context: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a primary genetic cause of autism, marked by sensory processing anomalies. In humans with FXS and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model: EEG shows enhanced resting gamma power and diminished sound-evoked gamma synchrony. Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9): Past studies indicate elevated MMP-9 levels might influence these EEG anomalies by affecting perineuronal nets (PNNs) around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Effects of Fmr1 Deletion in Excitatory Neurons: Cortical MMP-9 gelatinase activity, mTOR/Akt phosphorylation, and resting EEG gamma power increase. Density of PV/PNN cells decrease. CreNex1 /Fmr1Flox/y cKO mice show heightened locomotor activity but not anxiety-like behaviors. Implications: FMRP changes in cortical excitatory neurons can produce cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Suggests local cortical circuit abnormalities play a role in sensory processing deficits in autism spectrum disorders. Fragile X Syndrome and Sensory Processing Deficits: An In-depth Study Introduction Introduction &amp; Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic form of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, leading to downregulation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Symptoms include anxiety, intellectual disability, and abnormal sensory processing, particularly auditory hypersensitivity. Auditory Hypersensitivity in FXS: Both humans with FXS and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit auditory hypersensitivity. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in these subjects have shown increased resting EEG gamma band power, which could underlie sensory hypersensitivity. The Role of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9): MMP-9 levels are elevated in FXS brains and could affect the development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons. MMP-9 is secreted from various cell types including astrocytes and neurons. It can also mediate changes in synaptic functions through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Cell-Specific Effects: FMRP is expressed in multiple levels and cell types in the auditory pathway. The origin and cell type specificity of abnormal EEG recordings are still unknown. Objective of the Current Study: To understand the impact of deleting Fmr1 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons. Findings: Deletion of FMRP from forebrain excitatory neurons was sufficient to elicit FXS-associated symptoms. This includes enhanced MMP-9 activity, increased mTOR/Akt signaling, impaired PV/PNN expression, and hyperactive behaviors. Implications: The study suggests that FMRP in excitatory neurons is critical for normal cortical activity. Highlights novel mechanisms potentially leading to sensory hypersensitivity in FXS and possibly other forms of ASD. Result Goals: Check if issues in auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice persist in adulthood. Examine effects of FMRP deletion on brain and behavior. Key Results: Reduced density of PV cells in layer 4 of auditory cortex in Fmr1 KO mice. Lower density of WFA+ PNN cells in both layer 4 and 2/3 in Fmr1 KO mice. Poor formation of PNNs around PV cells in Fmr1 KO mice. Implications: The observed deficits are long-lasting, suggesting they may cause enhanced sound sensitivity in Fmr1 KO mice. FMRP Immunoreactivity Was Significantly Reduced in Excitatory Neurons of Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1Flox/y cKO Mice Method: Used CreNex1 and Fmr1flox/flox KO mice to specifically delete FMRP in forebrain excitatory neurons. Key Results: Significant reduction in FMRP in the auditory cortex of CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y cKO mice compared to controls. No significant change in cell density in the auditory cortex. No significant changes in FMRP expression in other parts of the auditory pathway like the inferior colliculus and auditory thalamus. Implications: The deletion of FMRP is specific to forebrain excitatory neurons in the auditory cortex and doesn’t affect other regions, confirming the targeted nature of the genetic manipulation. Deletion of FMRP from Excitatory Neurons Reduces PV, PNN, and PV/PNN Colocalization in the Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Method: Studied cell density in the auditory cortex of specific knockout mice (CreNex1/Fmr1Flox/y cKO) and control mice (Fmr1Flox/y). Results: Fewer PV cells in knockout mice in two brain layers (L4 and L2/3). Fewer WFA+ PNN cells in the same layers in knockout mice. Less overlap of PV and WFA+ PNN cells in knockout mice in both layers. Implications: Loss of FMRP in excitatory neurons affects these cells. This could disrupt overall brain network function. Total Aggrecan Levels Are Reduced, While Cleaved Aggrecan Levels and Gelatinase Activity Are Enhanced in the Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Method: Conducted a gelatinase activity assay and measured aggrecan levels in the auditory cortex of specific mouse models. Results: Higher gelatinase activity in both Fmr1 KO and Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice compared to controls. Lower levels of full-length aggrecan and higher levels of cleaved aggrecan in both Fmr1 KO and Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice. Increased ratio of cleaved aggrecan to total aggrecan in these mice. Implications: The increased gelatinase activity, likely due to elevated MMP-9 levels, may contribute to the loss of PNNs. The cleavage of aggrecan, a key component of PNNs, is also affected. The loss of FMRP in excitatory neurons may underlie these molecular changes, affecting overall neural network integrity. Deletion of FMRP from Excitatory Neurons Triggers a Decrease in PV Levels, While Akt and mTOR Phosphorylation Is Increased in Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Key Findings on PV Levels and Akt/mTOR Signaling Method: Measured levels of Parvalbumin (PV) and phosphorylated forms of Akt and mTOR in the auditory cortex of specific mouse models. Results: Significant decrease in PV levels in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO and Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice. Higher levels of phosphorylated (i.e., active) forms of Akt and mTOR in these mouse models compared to their controls. Implications: The decrease in PV levels is consistent with earlier findings in autism mouse models and might be linked to network dysfunction. Enhanced Akt/mTOR signaling could contribute to synaptic changes and hyperexcitability seen in FXS and other autism spectrum disorders. The deletion of FMRP in excitatory neurons is sufficient to trigger these molecular changes, pointing to its pivotal role in the auditory cortex of adult mice. Resting EEG Gamma Power Is Enhanced in the Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Key Findings on Impaired Neural Oscillations and Local Circuit Defects Objective: To determine if deficits in forebrain excitatory neurons cause abnormal neural oscillations similar to global Fmr1 KO mice. Methods: Baseline EEG raw power in auditory cortex examined for Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice (n=9) and control Fmr1Flox/y mice (n=9). Analyzed various frequency bands during a 5-minute resting period. Results: Enhanced high-frequency oscillations observed in the auditory cortex of Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice. Significant increase in low gamma power (30-55 Hz) in the auditory cortex of these mice. Implications: The abnormal low gamma power likely stems from local circuit defects, similar to global Fmr1 KO mice. These local circuit defects may be related to observed increases in gelatinase activity and reduced PV+ cell density and WFA+ PNNs around PV+ neurons. The results suggest that specific types of neurons may be critical for the neural oscillation abnormalities observed in FXS and potentially other autism spectrum disorders. This study adds to the understanding that local cortical circuit abnormalities, possibly related to impaired PV+ interneuron function, contribute to neural oscillation deficits in FXS. Gamma Synchronization Is Not Affected in Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mouse Auditory Cortex Key Findings on Phase Locking and Gamma Synchronization Objective: To investigate if increased baseline gamma in Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice impacts the consistency of sound-evoked gamma synchronization. Methods: Used “chirp” stimuli with varying modulation frequencies, both up and down, presented 300 times each. Employed Inter-Trial Phase Coherence (ITPC) analysis to measure phase consistency across trials. Results: Despite increased baseline gamma in Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice, there were no significant differences in gamma band ITPC compared to controls. Similar patterns observed for both up- and down-chirps. Implications: The lack of difference in gamma ITPC suggests that the gamma synchronization deficits in global Fmr1 KO mice are not solely due to excitatory neurons in the forebrain. This opens up the possibility that other cell types in the cortex or subcortical sites could be responsible for these deficits. The study suggests that while local circuit defects may contribute to baseline gamma power, they may not be the sole factor affecting gamma synchronization in response to auditory stimuli in FXS. Increased Non–Phase-Locked STP Is Observed in the Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice during Chirp Stimulation Studied gamma power in Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice. Found increased lower gamma power. Suggests local circuit issues. Induced Power Is Significantly Enhanced in the Auditory Cortex of Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Tested auditory cortex responses to noise bursts at 4 Hz and 0.25 Hz rates. Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice showed reduced phase locking in the beta range (20-30 Hz). Increased “ongoing” response was observed in the beta to low gamma range (10-50 Hz). These effects persisted in repeated sound stimulation. Results suggest increased variability and reduced suppression of ongoing activity in cKO mice. Excitatory Neuron-Specific Adult CreNex1 /Fmr1 Flox/y cKO Mice Display Increased Locomotor Activity, but No Anxiety-Like Behavior Mice were tested for activity and anxiety using elevated plus maze and open field (OF) tests. Cre Nex1/Fmr1 Flox/y cKO mice showed more arm entries and higher speed, indicating increased locomotor activity. No difference was observed in time spent in open arms, suggesting no change in anxiety levels. In the OF test, cKO mice also crossed more lines and moved faster, confirming increased activity. No significant difference in time spent in center or thigmotaxis, again suggesting no change in anxiety. Conclusion: Deleting FMRP from forebrain excitatory neurons increases activity but doesn’t affect anxiety-like behaviors. Discussion Study aims to understand sensory processing issues in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a genetic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Deleting Fmr1 from forebrain excitatory neurons causes abnormal EEG patterns in adult auditory cortex. This deletion also increases gelatinase activity, affecting Perineuronal Nets (PNNs) around Parvalbumin (PV) neurons. PV neurons are crucial for sensory processing; their dysfunction may underlie sensory issues in FXS. The study also finds higher mTOR/Akt phosphorylation in the cortex, suggesting altered signaling pathways. Reduced excitation to PV neurons may lead to their decreased activity and function. Low-gamma band power in auditory cortex is specifically increased; this could influence sensory and cognitive processes. Both cortical and sub-cortical structures likely contribute to auditory processing deficits in FXS. Future research is needed to explore effects of Fmr1 deletion in other brain areas and cell types for a system-level understanding. Role of Enhanced Gelatinase Activity in CreNex1 /Fmr1Flox/y cKO Mice The study elaborates on the intricate relationship between the loss of the FMRP protein and various neural and behavioral phenomena in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Here’s a breakdown: Molecular Mechanisms Perineuronal Nets (PNNs) and Parvalbumin (PV) Neurons: PNNs surround PV neurons and are crucial for their function. Aggrecan, a component of PNNs, is degraded by gelatinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), affecting the structure and function of PNNs. Gelatinase Activity: The study found increased gelatinase activity in the auditory cortex of mice lacking FMRP, indicating that this may contribute to impaired PNN formation. Signaling Pathways: Increased gelatinase activity can also affect the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways, which are implicated in FXS and regulate neuronal excitability. Auditory Cortex and Sensory Processing MMP-9 and Sensory Responses: Deletion or reduction of MMP-9 activity in mice normalized auditory responses and PNN formation, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Subcortical Contributions: While the study indicates cortical deficits, it also suggests that subcortical areas may contribute to the observed abnormalities. Behavioral Aspects Locomotor Activity: Mice with FMRP deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons showed increased locomotor activity but no anxiety-like behaviors. Role of FMRP in Other Areas: FMRP loss in other brain regions like the hippocampus may contribute to other FXS symptoms like learning and memory deficits. Future Directions Astrocytes and MMP-9: The study proposes to investigate how astrocytes may be involved in regulating MMP-9 activity and PNN formation. Multi-Electrode EEGs: To get a comprehensive understanding, the study recommends exploring electrocortical activity in different brain areas. Overall, the study provides a multi-faceted understanding of how FMRP loss impacts neural circuits and behaviors, offering potential therapeutic targets like MMP-9 for FXS. Certainly! Here’s a more elegant and concise summary of the research findings and their implications. Conclusion Key Insights Parvalbumin Neurons: Deletion of the Fmr1 gene in forebrain excitatory neurons impinges upon the integrity and function of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory neurons. Matrix Enzymology: Elevated activity of the enzyme MMP-9 remodels the extracellular scaffolding around PV+ neurons, potentially altering cellular signaling cascades. Electrophysiological Nuances: The study discerns a specific alteration in resting low-gamma EEG power, correlated with hyperactive behaviors but not with anxiety. Symptomatic Specificity: The research delineates that cortical deficits are responsible for some, but not all, features of Fragile X Syndrome, underscoring a nuanced impact of the Fmr1 deletion. Clinical Implications The findings elegantly illuminate avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies, offering the prospect of interventions honed to specific cellular actors and neural circuits implicated in Fragile X Syndrome. By delving into the intricacies of cellular and circuit-level changes, this study enriches our understanding of Fragile X Syndrome and opens new horizons for targeted therapeutic interventions. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/08/23/LearnNotes/acoustics/"},{"title":"Binomial Distribution | Introduction and examples","text":"What Is Binomial Video tutorial: Wrath of Math, 2017, YouTube Binomial is a simplistic polynomial. It has two terms, which could be numeral, variable, or combined element. for example: $3x +4$ $x+5$ $x^2 + 5x$ As you can see, they are all binomials. What Is Binomial Experiment A binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties: The experiment consists of n repeated trials. Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure. The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial. The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials. Cite: Stat Trek[1] For example, the experiment about flipping a coin and counting the probabilities of each side. Binomial Distribution A binomial random variable is the number of successes x in n repeated trials of a binomial experiment. The probability distribution of a binomial random variable is called a binomial distribution. [1:1] For example, when we flip a coin two times, We can have the results: Result Probability Head * 2 25% Head, Tail 50% Tail * 2 25% $$ b(x; n, P) = C_{n}^{x} * P^ x (1 - P)^{(n - x)} $$ $$ C_{n}^{x} = \\frac{ n!}{ x! (n - x)! } $$ The properties of the Binomial Distribution: The mean of the distribution $μx$ is equal to $n \\times P$ . The variance $σ2x$ is $nP( 1 - P) $. The standard deviation $σx$ is $\\sqrt{nP( 1 - P ) }$. AND $x$: The number of successes that result from the binomial experiment. $n$: The number of trials in the binomial experiment. $P$: The probability of success on an individual trial. $Q$: The probability of failure on an individual trial. (This is equal to 1 - P.) $n!$: The factorial of n (also known as n factorial). $b(x; n, P)$: Binomial probability - the probability that an $n$ trial binomial experiment results in exactly $x$ successes, when the probability of success on an individual trial is $P$. $C_n^x$: The number of combinations of $n$ things, taken $x$ at a time. Cite: Stat Trek[1:2] Example 1: Suppose a die is tossed 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 fours?[1:3] So, we have 5 times, which means $n = 5$; We need exactly four * 2, which means $x = 2$; The probability of a single trial is 1/6, which give $P = 1/6$ According to the function above, we can have: $b(2; 5, 1/6) = C_{5}^{2} * (1/6)^ 2 (1 - (1/6))^{(5 - 2)}$ In R, we can calculate the binomial with the function dbinom as dbinom(2, 5, 1/6). Now we have the results: $b(2; 5, 1/6) = 0.160751$ Example 2: $b(x; n, P) = \\frac{ n!}{ x! (n - x)!} \\times P^ x (1 - P)^{(n - x)}$ Let’s back to the coin. When we flip it once, and the chances of Head is obviously 50%. Which is: $b(1; 1, 1/2) = \\frac{ 1!}{ 1! (1 - 1)!} * 0.5^ 1 (1 - 1)^{(1 - 1)}$ $b(1; 1, 1/2) = 1 * 0.5 * 1$ $b(1; 1, 1/2) = 0.5$ When we flip it twice, we can have 4 results: HH, HT, TH, TT the chance we have only one head is dbinom(1, 2, 1/2), which is 50%. (HT, TH) the chance we have two heads is dbinom(2, 2, 1/2), which is 25%. (HH) the chance we have heads from 0 to all is: 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, which means $1: 2:1$ Now, let’s try to flip it triple times, so we have 8 results: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH HTT, THT, TTH, TTT one head: HTT, THT, TTH: $3/8 = 0.375$ $b(1; 3, 1/2) = \\frac{ 3!}{ 1!

It involves the systematic collection and analysis of data in order to understand and explain how individuals behave in certain situations. Behavioral research spans multiple disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, neurology, and even computer science, and it encompasses a variety of specific fields of study, such as behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and behavioral neuroscience. Here are a few reasons why we study behavior: Understand Mechanisms: Understanding the mechanisms that underlie behavior can give us insights into why individuals act the way they do. This can involve studying the brain and nervous system to understand the physiological basis of behavior. Predict Behavior: By understanding the factors that influence behavior, researchers can predict how individuals will behave in different circumstances. This has applications in many fields, from marketing (predicting consumer behavior) to public health (predicting adherence to health guidelines). Change Behavior: Once we understand and can predict behavior, we can also try to change it. This can involve designing interventions to promote beneficial behaviors or discourage harmful ones. Evaluate Interventions: Behavioral research is also used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to change behavior. How to study behaviors As for how we study behaviors, it often involves the following steps: Observation: The first step is often to observe the behavior in its natural context, in order to get a sense of what is happening and to generate hypotheses. Measurement: Researchers then need to find a way to measure the behavior in a systematic and reliable way. This can involve anything from timing a rat in a maze, to counting the number of times a bird performs a specific action, to administering questionnaires to human participants. Experimentation: Once the behavior has been measured, researchers can conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. This typically involves manipulating one or more variables and observing the effect on the behavior. Analysis: The data collected in the experiment is then analyzed, often using statistical methods, to determine whether the observed effects are statistically significant. Interpretation and Publication: The results are then interpreted in light of the original hypotheses, and the study is usually written up and published in a scientific journal, so that other researchers can evaluate and build on the findings. Overall, behavioral research is a vast field that offers insights into the complexities of behavior and provides a foundation for making predictions and interventions in various sectors of life and society. Common things we can do with in behavior analysis Social network analysis: Consider each animal as a node and an interaction as an edge in a network. You can use graph analysis techniques to identify which animals have the most interactions (central nodes), which ones tend to interact with each other (clusters), and whether the pattern of interactions changes over time. Behavioral change over time: Analyze the animals’ behaviors (like wing extensions or movement patterns) over time. Look for patterns or triggers for specific behaviors - do they happen more frequently at certain times or after specific interactions? Collective behavior: You can look at the group-level behaviors. For example, if the group tends to move together, you can calculate the polarization of the group, which is a measure of how much the animals’ movement directions align with each other. If the group tends to stay together, you can calculate the nearest neighbor distance or the density of the group, which are measures of the group’s cohesion. Individual vs. group behavior: Try comparing individual behaviors to the group behavior. Are there certain individuals that often initiate group movements? Are there individuals that often behave differently than the group? Correlation between movement and behavior: Investigate if there’s a correlation between the movement of an animal (speed, acceleration, etc.) and its specific behaviors like wing extensions. Does a specific behavior trigger a change in movement or vice versa? Response to stimuli: If your data includes any events or stimuli (like changes in the environment or the appearance of food or predators), you can analyze how these affect the animals’ behavior. Do these events trigger specific behaviors or changes in interaction patterns? To quantify the interactions, you could count the number of interactions each animal has, the frequency of interactions, the average duration of interactions, etc. You could also quantify the result of each interaction - for example, does one animal tend to move away after interacting with another? You would need to use statistical methods and possibly machine learning techniques to perform these analyses, depending on the complexity of your data and the questions you’re trying to answer. You might also find it helpful to visualize your data, both to help you understand it and to communicate your results to others. Something more we may can do Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis: You can use supervised learning if you have labeled data, or unsophisticated learning if you don’t, to discover patterns in the data and make predictions about future behavior based on past data. For example, you can try to predict when and where certain behaviors will occur, or predict the outcome of interactions based on their initial conditions. Multivariate Behavioral Analysis: Investigate the relationships between different behaviors. For example, does a wing extension by one animal often lead to a similar action by another animal? Or does a particular movement pattern often precede or follow certain interactions? These patterns might not be visible in a univariate analysis of individual behaviors, but may emerge when looking at multiple behaviors together. Complex Network Analysis: Go beyond basic social network analysis and use techniques from complex network analysis. For example, you might look at motifs (recurring patterns of interactions), centrality measures (which animals are most central or influential in the network), community structure (groups of animals that interact more with each other than with the rest of the group), etc. Spatio-temporal Analysis: Study the behavior of the group as a function of both space and time. For example, do the animals exhibit different behaviors or interactions in different parts of the container? Or at different times? Comparative Analysis: If you have data for different groups of animals, you might compare their behaviors. Are there consistent differences between groups, or between the same group at different times? Ethological Modeling: Based on your data, you could develop models of animal behavior. These models could be mathematical, computational, or conceptual, and they could help you better understand the principles underlying the behaviors you observe. Fractional Order Statistics: This is a newer branch of statistics that can be used to model complex systems, it might be helpful if the data shows heavy-tailed distributions or long-range correlations. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/07/27/LearnNotes/behavior-research/"},{"title":"Stem Cells: An Insider&#39;s Guide","text":"Stem Cells: An Insider’s Guide Author: Paul Knoepfler Just as the name of this book, it more reads like a guide, or, a collection of well-sorted and organized blog posts.

L state: loss conformation. it has a high affinity to ADP and inorganic phosphate. T state: tight conformation which is the high avidity for ATP Each $\\beta$ chain was bound with a molecule of ATP. As a result, three ATP are produced per turn of the stalk. Protons Caclultion There is 10 to 15 (#N) number of c-chains in a ring. So, it needs #N protons. to flow back to through F0. A full turn of c-chain also corresponded with producing 3 APT molecules. Therefore, the proton need for each ATP is #N/3 proton motive force ATP is used outside of mitochondria.

As a result, the ratio of ATP and AMP could regulate the activity of the PFK-1. $\\frac{[ATP]}{[AMP]}$ is high: - High energy state - ATP is abundant - PFK-1’s activity is suppressed. $\\frac{[ATP]}{[AMP]}$ is low: - Low energy state - ATP is a deficiency - PFK-1’s activity is increased. Why not ADP ADP is a poor indicator of the cell energy state indicator. Because: $$ 2 ADP \\overset{Adenylate \\ kinase}{\\longrightarrow} ATP + AMP $$ On the other hand, the AMP is more sensible to the ADP. concentration: $[AMP] &lt; [ADP] &lt; [ATP]$ changing scale: $AMP &gt; ADP &gt; ATP$ (sensitivity) others Citrate inhibited PFK-1 by enhancing the ATP inhibitor effect.

Low blood glucose As a result, the glycogen synthesis was inactivated. High blood glucose GSK is the inactivator of the Glycogen synthase. Without the inactivator, the activation of glycogen synthase was increased. PP1 PP1 is a part of a complex called Glycogen synthase phosphatase which contains Glycogen-targeting regulatory subunit. It’s a member of the family of glycogen-targeting regulatory subunits and could recruit the glycogen synthase phosphatase to glycogen particles. In high blood glucose level: PP1 dephosphorylates both enzymes (Glycogen synthase and Glycogen phosphorylase), so the glycogen synthase becomes activated, and the glycogen phosphorylase is now inactive. Inactivate a protein called phosphorylase kinase and inhibit glycogen breakdown Insulin would decrease the concentration of cAMP which responsible to activate PKA. (PKA could prohibit the function of PP1) (Glycogen phosphorylase: breakdown the glycogen) In low a concentration of blood glucose, PKA inhibits the PP1. ==In low blood glucose level Glycogen phosphorylase would bind to the Glycogen synthase phosphatase which inhibited the PP1. So, glycogen synthesis is inhibited. Glycogen-targeting regulatory subunit has two kinds of isoform: GL in the muscle. regulation in muscle low blood glucose PKA cold phosphorylates GM. Upon phosphorylation, PP1 dissociates from GM which could reduce the catalytic efficiency of PP1. (Substrate is recognized and recruited by GM). PKA also phosphorylates the inhibitor of the PP1 and then binds it to the PP1 to inhibit the activity of PP1. delay effect on synthase No additional Glucose: Glycogen phosphorylase is in an R state Added Glucose: turn to T state, PP1GL complex is released in now an active form. T state of Glycogen phosphorylase is more accessible for PP1GL complex PP1GL complex could now quickly bind the glycogen synthase and stimulation the glycogen synthesis Diabetes Diabetes Mellitus: Elevated levels of blood sugar Deficiency in insulin activity Two main groups of diabetes: Type I juvenile-onset diabetes (age of 25) Genetic, autoimmune, environmental Reduced insulin secretion $\\beta$-cell loss Hard to prevent Type II Adult-onset (40 to 60 years) Genetic and environmental factors Resistance towards insulin Eventual $\\beta$-cell loss and reduced insulin secretion relatively easy to prevent Gestational (pregnant woman) Temporary insulin resistance Relapse may occur (to Type II diabetes) Common complication: Hyperglycemia Organ damage (eyes, kidneys, and nerves.) Controlling Type II Diabetes: Long-term and continuous regulation of blood sugar Strict dietary control Type I diabetes (Insulin-dependent diabetes) Less than 10% of the diabetics sudden onset Immune system attacks $\\beta$-cells Causes: Viral infections initiate autoimmunity Genetic factors contribute Severe $\\beta$-cell loss = insufficient insulin secretion: undernourished underweight ketone body production metabolic acidosis lower the blood pH Coxsackievirus targets to pancreatic $\\beta$-cell and the $\\beta$-cell has a very limited ability of regeneration. Genetic factors: TYK2 TYK2 is the protein of which associate with interferon receptor, which presents INF $\\alpha/\\beta$ and recognized by the phagocyte. The ineffectiveness of TYK2 loss of function increases the protection against type 1 diabetes by decreasing the antiviral and apoptotic responses. PTPN2 could prevent the down-regulation of the antiviral in apoptotic activities. Lipolysis Inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase: HSL HSL could convert diacylglycerol into monoacylglycerol. Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis: Conversion of glucose to glycerol 3-P in liver and adipocytes. Increased TAG synthesis in liver and adipocytes Increased TAG transport from liver to adipocytes Upregulation of lipoprotein lipase gene Most tissues: Increased amino acid uptake Activation of translation initiation factors Activation of protein synthesis Hyperglycemia High glucose in blood, very low glucose in the cell High fasting blood glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL excess of glucose in the urine Osmotic pressure Exessive urination, polyuria, and dehydration Excessive thirst, polydipsia Cell stress Tissue Damage: Exp, oxidative damage in $\\beta$-cell Tissue starvation Polyphagia: (feel constantly hungry) Glyconeogenesis Hyperglycemia Degrade lipids to fatty acids adipose tissue wasting ketone bodies synthesis Low blood pH and ketoacidosis Hypertriacylglycerolemia Excessive very-low-density lipoproteins due to low activity of lipoprotein lipase Effect on insulin-insensitive tissues protein glycation small blood vessels retina red blood cells Treatment for Type I Diabetes It is caused by loss of insulin secretion because of loss of $\\beta$-cell. The obvious treatment is the administration of purified insulin. Subcutaneous injection (fat layer) Other injection sites (the part rich in adipose tissues) abdomen top of your thigh back of your arm pump-assisted infusion It should avoid quick absorption in order to prevent from frequent injection Exogenous insulin administration Standard intensive Healthy blood glucose level ~225mg/dL ~150mg/dL ~100mg/dL glycated Hb levels ~8-9% ~7% &lt; 6% Side effect: It was caused by the time and dose of the insulin injected.

Exp: MCP-1, a chemical that attracts macrophages. Glucose transport inside muscle is still normal Microphages infiltrated in adipose tissue secrete TNF-alpha Result: increase lipolysis followed by increased fatty acid export to tissue, including muscle. excessive fatty acid in tissue in ectopic fat deposition and interference with the targeting of glucose transporter at the surface of cells. The consequence is the progression toward full insulin resistance. One hypothesis: insulin overproduction Hyperglycemia could trigger a large amount of insulin production. Proinsulin is heavily produced in the inner cellular ER and Golgi system. Over synthesis of this could damage the function of the ER and Golgi, which failed to remove the C-protein and produce misfolded insulin. Accumulation of misfolded insulin triggered apoptosis. Conclusion: Obesity is a risk factor leading to ectopic fat deposition and ultimately to lipotoxicity and chronic inflammation which finally developed into insulin resistance and insulin deficiency.

Carbon is the base of life. But organisms are not only a piece of carbon. Living life constantly carries a series of energy exchange processes. Types of Metabolism Entropy and reaction Gibb’s free energy equation $$ G = H - TS $$ G: Free engergy H: Enthalpy T: Temperature S: Entropy Enthalpy (H): Total energy of the system (Energy in bonds) Entropy (S): Quantitative expression for the randomness of the system; (the disorder of the system, the amount of energy that cannot do work) Temperature (T): Temperature; Degrees Kelvin $TS$: Increased temperature intensifies random molecular motion, leading to increased disorder. Free Energy (G): The only portion of the energy that is able to do work. In a cell that carries reactions, the amount of energy lost as heat, which contributes to random motion, increased entropy, and the reaction was irreversible. Spontaneous Reaction In a spontaneous reaction, the free energy is decreased, therefor: $\\Delta G &lt; 0$ Because: $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$ As a result: $\\Delta H &lt; T \\Delta S$ So, $\\Delta H$ is negative: $(-)\\Delta H$, the heat is release, it is a exothermic reaction. $\\Delta H$ is positive: $(+)\\Delta H$, the heat is absorbed, it is a endothermic reaction.

Healthy population: $phenylalanine \\overset{PHA+BH_ 4}{\\longrightarrow} tyrosine$ PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase) BH4 is the cofactor of PAH PKU patients Inactivation of PAH makes phenylalanine remain at a toxic level among blood and tissues.

Treatment Most causes are the miss-fold of the protein. The PKU Diet The treatment is limited. The most popular measure is taking the PKU Diet which has limited phenylalanine. Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) It is a form of BH4. It works for some of the patients. But the PKU diet is still needed. PAH PAH belongs to a family of biopterin aromatic amino acid-dependent hydroxylases that convert phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan into tyrosine, L-DOPA, and oxitriptan respectively. The classic PKU is caused by the malfunction of PHA. The mild PKU is caused by the regeneration of BH4: $BH_ 2 \\overset{PCD+DHPR}{\\longrightarrow} BH_ 4$ Monomer PAH has three domains: Catalytic domain (73% of mutation) Self-association domain (6% of mutation) The regulatory domain (21% of mutation) allosteric mechanism Active form PAH is Tetramer Allosteric regulation Closed Ei form turn to Ea form when the regulatory domain was activated. Both regulatory domain and catalytic domain have a binding site of phenylalanine. BH4 BH4 is the coenzyme of PAH. It also binds the regulatory site and helps PAH to stay in an inactive form. Phosphorylation phosphorylating the serine residue occupying position 16 in the regulatory domain. PAH becomes active at a lower concentration of free phenylalanine. Treatment Limited intakes of protein-rich food like meat and potatoes Persisting neurological or psychosocial issues and poor quality of life despite early intervention Nutritional deficiencies due to diet The financial burden due to the cost of special medical food and dietary supplements. Phenylalanine in excess in the blood acts as a competitive inhibitor, limiting the transport of tyrosine and tryptophan in the brain. GMP GMP are proteins derived from whey, the residual liquid left after curd formation which is low in phenylalanine. neurological complication Despite the restricted diet, some patients still developed neurological complications because they have problems with BH4 biosynthesis or regeneration. 60% of them affect the enzymes PCD and DHPR. Among these patients, the administration of a daily dose of 20 mg of BH4 per kg body weight could improve this situation. BH4 acts as a PAH-specific chaperone to leading the correct folding.

First, we need to identify the $C_{\\alpha}$. It is placed right in the center which connected a carbon (grey in left), nitrogen (Blue in right), and two hydrogens (white in up and down) When measuring the $\\phi$, which is the angle of $C_{\\alpha}-N$ bond. After we overlap the $C_{\\alpha}$ and $N$ (from N to C), we could measure the angle by looking at carboxyls. In this case, I believe it is $90^{\\circ}$. When measuring the $\\psi$, which is the angle of $C_{\\alpha}-C$ bond. we overlap the $C_{\\alpha}$ and $C$ (from $C_{\\alpha}$ to $C$ carboxyl),and we can measure the angle by look at Aminos. Which I believe is around $155^{\\circ}$ PS: the angles are from 0 to 180 from clockwise and -0 to -180 from anti-clockwise. $\\phi$ $\\psi$ Ramachandran Plot: G.N. Ramachandran realized that not all $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles are allowed. When it goes into some specific angle, there are steric clashes. using molecular models to test the possible value of dihedral angles. only a few dihedral angles for normal natural proteins. The result was presented as a plot: Ramachandran Plot. Ramachandran Plot © HarvardX As shown in the Ramachandran plot, the dihedral angle falls into green forms alpha helix, hit in purple forms beta-sheet, or end in the grey area becomes a loop. Proline break alpha helix Proline break alpha helix Alpha helix In alpha-helix: Right-handed helix. each turn as 3.6 residues. Hydrogen bonds between nitrogen residue and carboxyl residue were formed. The side chain is towards us and slightly downwards towards the N-terminals. Exp: In a partial alpha-helix of ATP synthesis, all hydrophobic residues are in the same face which forms a hydrophobic core against another helix group. Beta sheet： string, arrow stands from N terminal to C terminal. Type: mixed, anti-parallel strands, parallel strands. When the beta-sheet was formed, the side chains were performed above or below the sheet. Exp: alternating aliphatic and polar residues could form a sheet with one hydrophobic side and one polar side. loop Alpha helix and beta-sheets need a series of repetitions to form a structure. If the pattern is not continued, they could be loops. So, all regions of the Ramachandran plot could form loops. glycine being very flexible, and proline being restricted, but being able to form cis peptide bonds. And so proline and glycine are often found within loop regions of proteins. Proline is technically an imino acid! This means that the R-group connects to the backbone at nitrogen AND C-alpha. This prevents hydrogen bonding that sustains the secondary structure of an alpha helix. Prolines are often found at the beginning and the end of alpha-helices. They can also make strong kinks in the helical structure because the N-terminal peptide bond is more constrained. Tertiary and Quaternary Structure Both structures are the result of non-covalent bond interactions: Van de Waals, hydrogen bond, and salt bridges. Tertiary: Arrangement of single peptide Quaternary: Arrangement of several peptides Example: alcohols dehydrogenase: Motif: The smallest secondary structures are assembled in a consistent way.

It is an independent folding unit in a protein. They can fold on their own when you isolate them independently from the rest of the protein. exp: Rossmann fold.

Thermodynamic Protein folding funnel © Jon Lieff, MD The image shows left gave an illustration of the protein folding that follows the thermodynamic stability. Though there are infinite conformations for peptides, some of them contain higher free energy ($G$) which makes them unstable. The lower they fall into, the less $G$ they have, and the more stable they are. This naturally leads the peptide to fold into one (or maybe a few?) more “favorable” conformation Hydrophobic effect: These hydrophobic interactions have an impact not just on the primary structure but then lead to changes seen in the secondary and tertiary structure as well.

As a result, placing more conical shape molecules in the inner layer helps the structure of the membrane more tightly. Cholesterol © pubchem; ID:5997 Cholesterol has four hydrocarbon rings and is very hydrophobic. It can interact with other structural lipids in the membrane. It limits lipids’ mobility and affects membrane fluidity. There are more than 1000 types of lipids we can find in an organism. And About 5% of the genes in a cell are for synthesizing lipids. Energy production of lipids Triacylglycerol Most Triacylglycerols are stored in a kind of cell named Adipocyte (Fat cell) in adipose tissue. With the adipocyte, the triacylglycerol was stored as very large lipid droplets which even against the membrane of the adipocyte. Immature adipocyte tissue: brown, large lipid droplets. Mature liver adipocytes: small and numerous lipid droplets. The DIFFERENT between Glycogen and triacylglycerol: The carbon in fatty acids is more reduced. As a result, one gram of the fatty acid has twice the energy as 2 gram glycogen after being completely oxidized. Hydrophobicity: The fatty acid was stored much tenser than the glycogen. The glycogen has 2/3 of the mass of water. Glycogen is a polymer of glucose units. Glycogen moves faster than triacylglycerol. On the other hand, triacylglycerol also contributed to the benefit of insulation and padding. Lipid Transportation Challenge 1: Hydrophobic Lipid droplets are surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids with hydrophilic group heads outside. lipid-protein: perilipin, which could form a layer on the outer surface of the lipid droplets. Challenge 2: Coordination Triacylglycerol degradation (Lipolysis): tri -&gt; di: ATGL (Adipose triglyceride lipase); di -&gt;Mono: HSL (Hormone-sensitive lipase); Mono-&gt;two: MGL (Monoacylglycerol lipase); How are these enzymes activated? ATGH needs ABHD5 to be recruited at the surface of the lipid droplets. HSL and FABP4 complex in free cytoplasm could not be recruited. Active: Hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline from the catecholamine family. When are they activated? Catecholamine (Receptor) -&gt; trimeric G protein. trimeric G protein -&gt; adenylyl cyclase adenylyl -&gt; ATP -&gt; cyclic AMP Cyclic AMP -&gt; PKA PKA -(phosphate)-&gt; perilipin and HSL Perilipin-P active ABHD5 to recruit ATGL remodeling the surface of the droplets, increasing the access of the enzyme HSL-P: It could be recruited by the surface of the droplets. Challenge 3: Release of fatty acid Free fatty acid + FABP4 (chaperone): through the cytoplasm. FA is exposed to the bloodstream and associated with serum albumin to travel into the tissue in need. Glycerol was exposed in the cytoplasm and went through the cytomembrane through aquaporin, a channel protein. And then, they were transported into the liver through the bloodstream.

As a result, the mitochondria can relocate through this work. The distribution of the mitochondria is diverse and depends on the type of the cell. For example, in neurons, mitochondria are rich in Axon Hillock[1] areas. Endosymbiosis: living together. Mitochondria Disease A cell could have a few or a more different set of mitochondria. As a result, people may look healthy though they carry malfunction mitochondria. Sometimes, the carrier who has enough healthy mitochondria could still cause problems. For example, her infant could be fetal because, during the egg division, one egg may randomly receive more malfunction-mitochondria and leading mitochondria diseases.

(It was approved in the UK but not in the US) Electronic Transport Chain Why electronic transport. The inner membrane is low-permeable for protons which could help to sustain a high proton gradient. The proton is the key to driving the F1F0APTase to synthesis the ATP by pumping the proton out of the matrix. Without the proton gradient, the ATP could not be generated and the cell would die. General: Complex I, III, and IV: directly pump the proton into the intermembrane space (have both electron carrier and proton pump). Complex II can promote the activity of complex III and IV. (has electron carrier only) They get the energy for pumping by transferring electrons through a series of coupled reactions. This linked process is what we call the electron transport chain. Complex I: NADH deposit two high-energy electrons and passed along Redox Centers. Redox Center: The bottom of the center has high affinity than the top. The adjacent redox center is ideal for electron jump. small energy was released by each jump which would be used to pump protons. The last redox center was passed two electrons to a Coenzyme Q Complex II: Similar to the complex I. High energy was released from FADH2 Electron was delivered into Coenzyme Q through the redox center. Difference: The liberated energy doesn’t use to pump protons. Complex III: The electrons were released from Coenzyme Q one electron was recyclable, the other will pass through two redox centers before reaching cytochrome C cytochrome C carry the electron into Complex IV Complex IV: four electrons convert a molecule of oxygen to two molecules of water. Coenzyme Q is hydrophobic and diffusion inner the bilayer. Cytochrome C is a peripheral protein and is associated with the inner face of the inner face membrane.

Here, we develop a high-throughput assay to measure olfactory behavior in response to well-controlled sensory stimuli. We show that odor evokes two behaviors: an upwind run during odor (ON response), and a local search at odor offset (OFF response). Wind orientation requires antennal mechanoreceptors, but search is driven solely by odor. Using dynamic odor stimuli, we measure the dependence of these two behaviors on odor intensity and history. Based on these data, we develop a navigation model that recapitulates the behavior of flies in our apparatus, and generates realistic trajectories when run in a turbulent boundary layer plume. The ability to parse olfactory navigation into quantifiable elementary sensori-motor transformations provides a foundation for dissecting neural circuits that govern olfactory behavior.

The algorithm was first introduced by Thomas M. Fruchterman and Edward M. Reingold in 1991. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm works by simulating a physical system in which the nodes of a graph are treated as objects with electrical charges and the edges of the graph are treated as springs. The nodes are initially placed at random positions in the 2D or 3D space, and then the algorithm iteratively adjusts the position of the nodes based on the repulsion between the nodes and the attraction between the connected nodes. The nodes that are connected by an edge are pulled closer together, while the nodes that are not connected are pushed apart. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm aims to minimize the total energy of the system by finding an equilibrium state where the forces between the nodes and edges are balanced. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the positions of the nodes until it reaches the equilibrium state. The result is a visually pleasing graph layout that allows the viewer to easily see the connections and relationships between the nodes. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm is widely used in many fields such as social network analysis, information visualization, and bioinformatics. It has been implemented in many software packages, including Gephi, Cytoscape, and NetworkX. Fruchterman–Reingold is a type of layout which widely be used in the network, social network and protein-protein interaction network for instance, analysis. Who sad this? So, imagine that all the nodes are electrons that carry the same charge. As a result, they prefer to stay away from each other and distribute evenly in a limited space. However, the connections (edges) work like springs that pull two nodes together. If two groups have connections that frequently occur within the group, those nodes would prefer to be close to each other and form two large clusters because of the “springs”. The two groups would be away from each other because no/or a few of spring pulls them together, and the two huge groups of nodes would push the nodes outside the cluster. If a new node is added that has connections to both clusters and the number is significant enough, it could form an hourglass-like structure. And if there are a few other connections between two clusters at the same time, it would merge the two groups into a single one. Harel–Koren Fast Multiscaling layout Want to know more? This algorithm was published in 1991 by Fruchterman &amp; Reingold[1]. It is a undirected layout and modified from the spring-embedder model and VLSI technique called force-directed placement. By this methoud, it is mainly concerned about: Distribute the vertices evenly in the frame. Minimize edge crossings. Make edge lengths uniform. Reflect inherent symmetry. Conform to the frame.

One important technique for studying gene regulation and determining protein–DNA interactions is the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). An advantage of studying protein–DNA interactions by an electrophoretic assay is the ability to resolve complexes of different stoichiometry or conformation. Another major advantage is that the source of the DNA-binding protein may be a crude nuclear or whole cell extract, in vitro transcription product or a purified preparation. EMSA can be used qualitatively to identify sequence-specific, DNA-binding proteins (such as transcription factors) in crude lysates and, in conjunction with mutagenesis, to identify the important binding sequences within the upstream regulatory region of a given gene. EMSA can also be utilized quantitatively to measure thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. @ ThermoFisher 2022 Brief explained: During Gel electrophoration, if we add DNA (oligo) and protein together and the protein could interact with the DNA, the transfer speed of DNA is much slower because protein is dragging them.

(documentation) © ThermoFisher According its documentation, a group should have at least 3 tracks: labeled DNA: which works as negative control. It shows them band when there are no protein-DNA interaction. labeled DNA + protein: The main track for results. The position of DNA shifts because proteins interact with them. The movement of DNA is hindered by proteins. labeled DNA + protein + overload unlabeled DNA: By competition, most proteins interact with unlabeled DNA because the quantity of them is higher them labeled. As a result, we can see a dim-shifted band or no shifted band at all. The track could eliminate false positives brought by protein-label tag binding.

Luciferase Report Assay What is a Luciferase Report Assay? A luciferase reporter assay is a test that investigates whether a protein can activate or repress the expression of a target gene using luciferase as a reporter protein (Carter &amp; Shieh, 2015). The synthesis of the reporter protein and the addition of a substrate results in a chemical reaction with bioluminescence (or the emission of photons) as a by-product. This bioluminescence directly corresponds with the effect of the protein on expression of the target gene. © GoldBio, 2022; © Scholl, et al., 2014 © GoldBio, 2022; Scholl, Zackary &amp; Yang, Weitao &amp; Marszalek, Piotr.

Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure. The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial. The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials. The experiment continues until r successes are observed, where r is specified in advance. Consider the following statistical experiment. You flip a coin repeatedly and count the number of times the coin lands on heads. You continue flipping the coin until it has landed 5 times on heads. This is a negative binomial experiment because: The experiment consists of repeated trials. We flip a coin repeatedly until it has landed 5 times on heads. Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes - heads or tails. The probability of success is constant - 0.5 on every trial. The trials are independent; that is, getting heads on one trial does not affect whether we get heads on other trials. The experiment continues until a fixed number of successes have occurred; in this case, 5 heads.

The Mean of the Negative Binomial Distribution $μ = r / P$ $μ$ is the mean number of trials $r$ is the number of successes $P$ is the probability of a success on any given trial. Alternative Views of the Negative Binomial Distribution $μ_ R = kP/Q$ $R$: The negative binomial random variable $k$: the number of successes before the binomial experiment results in k failures $μK = rQ/P$ $K$: The negative binomial random variable $r$: the number of failures before the binomial experiment results in r successes Geometric Distribution The geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution.

Abstract Researches of the relation between obesity and aging. Obesity types: high-fat diet high-sugar diet Energy Homeostasis in Drosophila nad Humans Circulating and Stored Sources of Energy Trehalose is the predominant sugar in flies (like the glycemia in human). Open circulation system: In human, hyperglycemia leades vascular related diseases. But drosophila has open circulation system, which means it’s vascular would not affected by hyperglycemia. Glycogen and lipid: Like mammals, extral energy material was stored in this way. Fat body consist of: polyploid multinucleate cells Regulation of the Energy Balance by the Insulin-Like and Glucagon-Like Pathways Eight insulin-like peptides (Ilp1–8) Insulin-like receptor, InR. glycemia control: Ilp2,3,5 which from median neurosecretory cells of the brain Regulation Pathway in Different Age: median neurosecretory cells: In laver: unable to sense circulating sugars regulated indirectly via the glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH), and several other hormones In adult: It sense circulating glucose directly, via a mechanism similar to mammalian pancreatic β cells Fat body Fat body-specific manipulations of the InR indicate that analogously to human insulin, the fly IIS is a positive regulator of fat storage. $InR\\uparrow \\ \\to fat\\ content\\uparrow$ $IIS\\downarrow \\ \\to fat\\ content\\uparrow$ IIS is responsible to glycogen storage. IIS positively regulates glycogen synthesis. An additional IIS-independent factor that promotes glycogen synthesis: ablation of the insulin-producing cells in the brain [32] or Ilp2-3,5 deficiency [33] lead to increased glycogen storage AKH $\\to$ hyperglycemic functions Corpora cardiaca is an endocrine organ which could produce AKH Laval: it was in ring gland. Adult: migrate towards the thorax, and attaches to the esophagus, and sends axon-like projections toward the brain and crop AKH: Mutatans: obeses. Over expression: lean phenotype. AKH does not induce catabolism of glycogen Glycogen levels rise upon Akh overexpression AKH is a hyperglycemic hormone (above two) Lifespan in Different Types of Fly Obesity HIhg Sugar Diet (HSD)-Induced Obesity HSD diet: 1. 30% sugar; 2. 50–150% increased fat. HSD effects: delays larval development reduces fecundity increases the age-independent mortality Galenza, et al.[1]: Increased early mortality of flies Lifespan extension by 31% Tânia Reis[2]: Early mortality has a bimodal distribution Lifespan was mildly increased HSD increased the expression of the Ilp2,3, and 5 but InR are not response to it due to the increased levels of te Ilp-binding protein, lipocalin neural Lazarillo. HSD-fed laval even resistance recombinant insulin. Adult: IIS independently of insulin resistance causing decreased expression of Ilp2, 3, and 5 the periphery remains insulin sensitive HSD-fed damage is simmilar to the Ilp2-3,5 triple mutants. HSD leads to dysfunction of pericardial nephrocytes (cells that simmilar like human kideny) which responsible to a shorter lifespan consequence. pharmacological inhibition of the hexosamine pathway extends the lifespan on HSD Reduction of fly fitness: short-term exposure to HSD: causes a long-lasting reprogramming of the signaling in the fat body Sugar overload: numerous fat body-unrelated processes Increases endoplasmic reticulum stereoisomerism Decreases immunity, disrupts gut homeostasis, and reduces commensal bacteria HSD: causes heart disorders such as fibrillations, asystolic periods, and arrhythmias, leading to progressive heart failure Heart: hexosamine flux nad the cardiac-specific reduction of this pathway fully protects the heart from the HSD-induced pathologies HSD without additional water access: hyperosmolarity or hypovolemia; reduced body water content; Dietary Restriction (DR) and the Paradox of Carbohydrate-Rich Diet DR: intermittent fasting leads to increased, compensatory feeding protein leverage hypothesis: reduction of proteins increases appetite. restriction of certain nutrients food dilution. Results: protein restriction increases both lifespan and fat reserves high carbohydrate/low protein diet extends lifespan, whereas the caloric restriction itself does not DR reduces IIS activity Lifespan extension in flies is mediated by the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pharmacological inhibition of the TOR pathway by rapamycin not only extends lifespan, but also increases fat reserves The HFD-Induced Obesity HFD: 20% to 30% coconut oil, or 15% lard. Leads to: obesity, hyperglycemia reduced cardiac contractility, ectopic accumulation of fat in the heart other pathologies reminiscent of the diabetic cardiomyopathy associated with lifespan reduction Increases TGF-β signaling: responsible for the development of insulin resistance genetically enhanced lipolysis targeted to the heart is sufficient to prevent the HFD-triggered cardiac dysfunctions overactivation of immune responses Obesity and Longevity in the Flies with Abrogated Reproduction Reduced reproduction is associated with increased fat accumulation and longevity… numerous treatments that result in longevity and excessive fat storage decrease fertility. some case: reduced reproduction correlates with obesity, but not with lifespan extension lifespan-extension associated with inhibition of breeding sometimes correlates with reduced fat reserves ecdysteroids the only steroid hormones in Drosophila, which could mediate the trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan reduced ecdysteroid levels or mild RNAi against the Ecdysone receptor (EcR) extends lifespan in males regulate maturation; reproduction; EcR acts as a negative regulator of fat accumulation in larvae. Genetic Links between Fat Storage and Lifespan attenuation of the IIS and TOR signaling—also result in obesity… long-lived Methuselah (Mth) mutants have increased starvation resistance Drosophila lines selected for longevity have increased resistance to starvation, suggesting higher energy reserves… increased starvation resistance resulted in increased fat storage, suggesting that longevity and obesity are determined by the same genetic variants… Nevertheless, there are also longevity selection lines without increased resistance to starvation Lifespan in Other Genetic Models of Obesity severe obesity can be triggered via inhibition of either lipolytic pathway: lipase Brummer: doubling of the fat, in a mild reduction of lifespan. AKH hormone signaling: fat is increased by around 75–100%; lifespan is reduced only moderately obesity associated with euglycemia can be triggered by manipulations of calcium signaling via Stim RNAi Pathways and Tissues Linking Lipid Metabolism and Lifespan The IIS and AKH Endocrine Systems HSD and HFD increase expression of the fly homolog of leptin, unpaired2 (upd2). typical models of fly obesity also have reduced insulin-like signaling. HSD in adult flies reduces expression of all three brain-produced Ilps, while the periphery remains insulin-sensitive. HFD leads to reduced peripheral IIS, and to insulin resistance HSD in flies leads to increased signaling via the analogous AKH hormone. HSD in adult flies reduces expression of all three brain-produced Ilps, while the periphery remains insulin-sensitive. The Fat Body The expression of hh(Hedgehog) increases upon starvation, when the Hh pathway promotes mobilization of lipid reserves in the fat body The Heart Under HFD, the apolipoproteins derived from cardiomyocytes, and not those produced by the fat body, are the predominate regulators of lipid metabolism The Immune Cells HFD: enhanced production of the macrophage-derived cytokine Upd3, HFD shortens lifespan solely via the Upd3-dependent inflammatory response, and not via the increase in fat storage. The Pericardial Nephrocytes HSD in flies leads to damage of the pericardial nephrocytes, which is a condition reminiscent of the diabetic nephropathy The Gut The JNK pathway promotes further overproliferation of intestinal stem cells, which is directly responsible for lifespan shortening. Experimental inhibition of the JNK pathway, or overexpression of Mag in the intestine increases fat reserves in old flies Moderate inhibition of the JNK pathway also extends lifespan Galenza, A.; Hutchinson, J.; Campbell, S.D.; Hazes, B.; Foley, E.

Brief To create the large zone of Src-family kinase (SFK) phosphorylation required for phagocytosis, a cascade of integrin activation, emanating from antigen contact sites, generates an expanding actin-based diffusion barrier that restricts the access of the bulky phosphatase molecules that target SFK. Highlights Tyrosine phosphatases are excluded from sites of phagocytosis An expanding diffusion barrier prevents phosphatase access to sites of phagocytosis Integrins activated by phagocytic receptors generate the diffusion barrier Activated integrins bridge sparse phagocytic receptors and coordinate phagocytosis Summary © Spencer A Freeman, et al. Phagocytosis activate Phagocytosis is initiated by lateral clustering of receptors, which in turn activates Src-family kinases (SFKs). Activation of SFKs requires depletion of tyrosine phosphatases from the area of particle engagement. Fcg The mobility of CD45 increased markedly upon engagement of Fcg receptors. While individual CD45 molecules moved randomly, they were displaced from the advancing phagocytic cup by an expanding diffusional barrier. By micropatterning IgG, the ligand of Fcg receptors, we found that the barrier extended well beyond the perimeter of the receptor-ligand engagement zone. Second messengers generated by Fcg receptors activated integrins, which formed an actin-tethered diffusion barrier that excluded CD45. The expanding integrin wave facilitates the zippering of Fcg receptors onto the target and integrates the information from sparse receptor-ligand complexes, coordinating the progression and ultimate closure of the phagocytic cup. Introduction Phagocytosis is initiated by a clustering of receptors. Fcg receptor could recognize the Fc portion of IgG in phagocytic response. The Multiplicity of IgG stimulate the Src-family kinase (SFKs) CD45 and CD148 on phagocytes are tyrosine phosphatases. SFKs activation needs the remove of phosphatases.

Abstract Dementia is related to the cellular accumulation of β‑amyloid plaques tau aggregates α‑synuclein aggregates neurotransmitter defciencies in the dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways Cause: Cellular and neurochemical changes Challenge: the role of dopaminergic and cholinergic networks in metabolic connectivity at diferent stages of dementia remains unclear Methods: 18F‑fuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F‑FDG PET) imaging data to construct dopaminergic and cholinergic metabolism network and used PHN analysis to track the evolution of these networks in patients with diferent stages of dementia. Result: The sums of the network distances in the Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment cohorts is diferences Conclusion: A larger distance between brain regions can indicate poorer efciency in the integration of information. PHN analysis revealed the structural properties of and changes in the dopaminergic and cholinergic metabolism networks in patients with diferent stages of dementia at a range of thresholds. This method was able to identify dysregulation of dopaminergic and cholinergic networks in the pathology of dementia. Introduction Dementia Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease[1]: a progressive and chronic loss of function in cognitive motor sensory Caused by: β-amyloid plaques tau aggregates α-synuclein aggregates neurotransmitter deficiencies in the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. Cholinergic circuity affects attention and cognition, memory and reward dysfunction, Else: Dopamine, α-synuclein werer related. 18F-FDG PET Advantage: The main advantage of 18F-FDG PET is its high sensitivity in detecting pathologies at the molecular level, due to the transportation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose into the intracellular space by glucose-1 transporters and its subsequent phosphorylation through the hexokinase reaction… Each brain region can be assumed to exchange information directly or indirectly with other parts of the network through synchronized fluctuations in glucose uptake… Using the 18F-FDG PET metabolic network, local neural activity, disconnection, and neuropathology effects can be observed. Result striatocortical pathways in Dopaminergic The SLD (single linkage distance) represents the functional distance between two brain regions SLD is higher in the AD and MCI groups compared with the SCD and HC groups. When λ increased, the dendrogram indicated that modularity occurred from the dorsal striatum to the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices and that the supplementary motor regions had large delays in connectivity in patients with AD and MCI, but most markedly for MCI. When λ increased, the clustering of brain connections occurred more slowly and at a longer distance (less efficiency in the network): MCI &gt; AD &gt; SCD &gt; HC.

Endothelin-1 mediated vasoconstriction leads to memory impairment and synaptic dysfunction. Sci Rep 11, 4868 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84258-x Abstract Cerebrovascular lesions are seen as white matter hyperintensity in MRI. It could be caused by micro-infracts and micro-bleeds and changing the blood flow to impair the cognitive deficits. We developed a model to study related impact by injecting ET-1 into C57 mice. The impediment in cerebral blood flow decreased CD31 expression around the hippocampal region, leading to memory deficits after 7 days. AKT-mTOR signaling cascade was downregulated but reversed after 30 days. activities depending on protein translation in the hippocampus were decreased. Introduction Dementia covers Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Lewy body dementia, and Vascular Dementia (VD). The diagnosis of those diseases is relied on neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and pathological confirmation. Vasoconstriction over time contributes to VD, and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is being recognized as a major factor leading to cognitive impairment. We developed a mouse model of vasoconstriction predominantly in small vessels by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ET-1 into lateral ventricles, bilaterally, which allowing ET-1 to spread through cerebrospinal fluid. Result Decreased expression of CD31 after 3 days injection Vasoconstriction leads to learning and memory deficits 7 days after injection Activation of microglia and increase in Iba1 expression after injection Activity-dependent protein translation is curtailed in synaptoneurosomes from the hippocampus of mice injected with ET-1 Akt‑1 and GSK phosphorylation are downregulated during the transient ischemia caused by ET‑1 injection. Memory impairment and synaptic function caused by a single dose of ET‑1 were reversed in 30 days. Discussion The model is successful and it led to significant effects on the mouse. ET-1 injection (2 µg) produces irreversible, focal lesion in locomotion and or memory depending on site of injection[2][3][4], low doses of ET-1 (0.5–1 μg) produces infarct induced lesion that is largely resolved by 3 days[5]. A higher dose (4 µg/ mouse) into the cortex results in mortality[6] CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) subsequently flows through the ventricular system of the brain, which consists of the two lateral ventricles and the third ventricle, which finally connects to the subarachnoid space… It has been shown that active transport can be bi-directional over the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus[7]. The direction of flow, the anatomical structures involved, and the driving forces that are involved in interstitial fluid and CSF flow are controversial[8][9]… Thus, the model was able to deliver a sufficient dose of ET-1. Synaptic plasticity is an important attribute for learning and memory and activity-dependent protein translation at the synapse is essential for synaptic plasticity… S35 methionine incorporation increased significantly in vehicle injected mice upon stimulation with KCl this was not observed in ET-1 treated mice indicating that activity dependent protein translation was non-existent following ET-1 treatment. Our results indicate for the first time the commonality between vasoconstriction in brain and early AD in downstream pathways that drive the behavioral abnormalities. Downregulated: Akt1 (Ser473 and Tr308)*, pmTOR, pS6k and p4EBP1 The loss of Akt1 kinase leads to downregulation in Akt-mTOR pathway which finally repressed activities dependent on protein translation[10]. ET-1 effects reversed after 30 days, much like that in patients with transient ischemic insults. Epstein FH, Martin JB. Molecular basis of the neurodegenerative disorders. New Engl. J.

It includes: RNA viruses that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp). Reverse-transcribing viruses (with either RNA or DNA genomes) that encode an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase(RdDp). RdRp and RdDp enzymes are essential for replicating the viral genome and transcribing viral genes into messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of viral proteins. Riboviria likely descended from non-viral elements that encode reverse transcriptase. It has few prokaryotic viruses, and includes most eukaryotic viruses. Well known species are included: coronaviruses, ebola virus, HIV, influenza viruses, rabies virus, and Tobacco mosaic virus. Characteristics RdRp: Based on the Baltimore classification system: positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses negative sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA) Viral mRNA is translated by the host cell’s ribosomes to produce viral proteins. In order to produce more viruses, viral RNA-dependent polymerases use copies of the viral genome as templates to replicate the viral genome. For +ssRNA viruses, an intermediate dsRNA genome is created from which +ssRNA is synthesized from the negative strand. For -ssRNA viruses, genomes are synthesized from complementary positive sense strands. dsRNA viruses replicate their genomes from mRNA by synthesizing a complementary negative sense strand to form genomic dsRNA. For dsDNA-RT viruses, pregenomic RNA created from the cccDNA is retrotranscribed into new dsDNA genomes. For +ssRNA-RT viruses, the genome is replicated from the integrated genome. After replication and translation, the genome and the viral proteins are assembled into complete virions, which then leave the host cell. Some virus photos © Mazen S.

Merrifield The hypothesis: All of the information needed to determine the structure of a protein is contained within its amino acid sequence The experiment: Ribonuclease in an enzyme with 4 Cys-Cys disulfide bonds The correct linkage is essential for enzymatic activity Anfinsen purified ribonuclease from cow pancreas, and then reduced the disulfide bonds with mercaptoethanol and unfolded the protein with 8 Molar urea (It was completely inactive) The reduced and denatured protein was put into a solution that favored oxidation of disulfide bonds. The observations: There are 105 different arrangements of the S-S bonds but only the single native arrangement gives active enzyme Ribonuclease reoxidized in the presence of 8M Urea gave 1% activity Ribonuclease oxidized in the absence of Urea gave ~100% activity The conclusion: All of the information needed to determine the structure of a protein is contained within its amino acid sequence The confirmation Robert Merrifield synthesized ribonuclease chemically and got active enzyme.

Enzymes accelerate reaction rates through the formation of weak bonds (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals interactions) between the enzyme and the substrate. Enzymes use the energy from the formation of these weak bonds help arrange the substrate in a position favorable for a chemical reaction. Catalysis by Transition- state Stabilization Rate 315 times faster when R=CH3 than when R=H Specific Geomitric complementarity and electronic complementarity contribute the specific of the enzyme. Stereospecific: target into one kind of chiral only. Geometric Specificity: identities of the chemical groups on their substrates. Transition State Analogues The transition state is a “fleeting molecular moment” where events such as bond breakage, bond formation, and charge development have proceeded to a point at which decay to either substrate or product is equally likely. Stable molecules designed to resemble this transition state are called transition state analogues. They often bind to enzymes more tightly than either the substrate or the product. This principal has been used to increase the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals. Most of the HIV protease inhibitors used to treat AIDS are transition state analogues. Transition-state Analogs The properties of enzymes control the fate of most cellular metabolites The ~ 500 reactions that comprise human metabolism are all catalyzed by enzymes. Lehninger, Figure 15-1 Enzymes can be classified according to the reactions they catalyze Oxidation states of biological carbon molecules Oxidation states of biological carbon molecules Oxidation states of biological sulfur Biological oxidation-reduction reactions utilize mobile or protein-bound electron carriers Oxidized Forms NAD+ NADP+ FAD FMN Reduced Forms NADH NADPH FADH2 FMNH2 NAD+ Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide NADP+ Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate FAD Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide FMN Flavin Mononucleotide Electrons on NADH and FADH2 are used primarily to generate ATP via electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Electrons on NADPH are used to provide reducing equivalents during synthetic reactions. Oxidoreductases catalyze redox reactions Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a glycolytic enzyme present in a number of different tissues. LDH isozymes (enzymes with different structures that catalyze the same reaction) are sometimes measured in serum as an indicator of cell damage. Transferases catalyze the transfer of a functional group from one molecule to another Hexokinase is an transferase that transfer a phosphate from ATP to a hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose-6-phosphate. In most organisms, glucose is the most important substrate and of hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate is the most important product. Hydrolyases catalyze the transfer of a donor group to water. Water is added and 2 molecules are formed from 1. Glucose 6-phosphatase is a hydrolase in the gluconeogenic pathway that removes a phosphate group from the C-6 hydroxyl group of glucose to form glucose and inorganic phosphate. Lyases add or remove elements of carbon dioxide, ammonia or water (without making two molecules from one). Fumerase is an lyase enzyme in the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle. Note that water is added, but this enzyme does not make 2 molecules from one. Isomerases are enzymes that catalyze intramolecular rearrangements. All the atoms in the substrate are also present in the product, just in a different configuration. Phosphoglucomutase is an isomerase that interconverts glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1- phosphate. This enzyme is required for the synthesis of glycogen and complex carbohydrates. Ligases catalyze synthetic reactions where 2 molecules are joined at the expense of a “high energy phosphate bond” , usually ATP or GTP. No part of the ATP or GTP ends up in the product. Pyruvate carboxylase is a ligase important in the gluconeogenesis. It is also used to replenish intermediates in the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Substrate Specificity Lock-and-key model refers to complementarity between enzymes and substrates Induced fit refers to conformational change upon substrate binding – accommodation of multiple substrates Example of “high” specificity (stereospecificity) 3-point- attachment results in stereospecific product Example of “low” specificity (geometric) Example of enzyme that uses a coenzyme/cosubstrate MECHANISMS OF CATALYSIS Acid-base Catalysis Covalent Catalysis Metal Ion Catalysis Catalysis by Transition- state Stabilization Rate 315 times faster when R=CH3 than when R=H Catalysis by Proximity and Orientation Catalytic triad of chymotrypsin and other serine proteases ES complex Serine protease mechanism ES complex Tetrahedral intermediate","link":"/2021/10/05/LearnNotes/tulane-biochem-9/"},{"title":"Lipids, Membranes and Membrane Proteins|Graduate Biochemistry 7| Tulane","text":"Overview A cell is a membrane-rich environment Classes of lipids Structure of lipids Polymorphic phase behavior of lipids The lipid bilayer membrane The fluid mosaic model of biological membranes Classes and functions of membrane proteins Folding and structure of membrane proteins Hydropathy plots A cell is a membrane-rich environment Classes of Lipids Fatty acid (e.g. palmitate, oleate) Energy storage metabolite Building block of other lipids Triacylglycerols (fat) Energy storage Glycerophospholipids Form lipid bilayer membrane Signal transduction Sphingolipids Form lipid bilayer membranes Signal transduction Steroids Rigidify membranes (Cholesterol) Membrane-crossing hormones (e.g. Estrogen) Fatty Acids - structure and nomenclature Fatty acid rules of nomenclature Carbon numbering start at carboxyl carbon Double bonds are numbered at the first carbon cis configuration is normal (trans is specified) Syntax for nomenclature length:#double bonds (list of double bond locations) 16:0 = palmitic acid 18:1(9) = oleic acid (sometimes written 18:1(Δ9)) 20:4(5,8,11,14) = arachidonic acid palmitic acid oleic acid arachidonic acid © PubChem ID= 985, 445639, 444899 Typical eukaryotic fatty acid structure Even number of carbons Non-conjugated double bonds (double bonds are separated by at least one CH2) Double bonds are normally cis If a double bond is trans it is specified in the name PS: Even number: Synthesis and degraded of the fatty acid are occur two carbons at a time.

In the RBC, the cholesterol in cytomembrane could up to 50% and which makes the membrane very rigidity. (try to keep it’s shape when it through the catepillars) Lake of most membrane proteins. As a contrast, the mitochondria’s membrane does not have cholesterol and has very high fluidity which needs to go constant conformation change. One of the fluidity membrane we know are rod and cone cell which are light recept cells. They need to interact quickly. As a result, they are made highly portion of the saturated fatty acids and very little of cholesterol. Steroid Hormones © PubChem These hormones are both soluble in water and lipids.

The different clustering algorithms developed during the years by the researchers, lead to different clusters to the same dataset, even for the same algorithm, the selection of different parameters or the presentation order of data objects may greatly affect the eventual clustering partitions How it works Confirm data is metric Scale the data Select Segmentation Variables Define similarity measure Visualize Pair-wise Distances Method and Number of Segments Profile and interpret the segments Robustness Analysis Cite: T. Evgeniou[1] Major Types of Clustering Algorithms © Adil Fahad; 2014 Commonly Used Types of Clustering Algorithms in Biomedical Research The 3 commonly used types of clustering algorithms are: Hierarchical-based clustering considers grouping data objects with a sequence of nested partitions, and attempts to build a tree-like, nested, hierarchical structure that partitions a dataset Partitioning-based clustering partitions a dataset into a particular # of clusters denoted by K, no hierarchical structure, and therefore attempts to seek a K-partition of a dataset Model-based clustering [e.g., mclust, Expectation-Maximization (EM), COBWEB, and Self-Organizing Map (SOM)] applies predefined mathematical models for fitting the dataset and then, tries to optimizes them. The basic assumption is that the dataset is a mixture (i.e., hybrid) of several probability distributions. Such algorithms can determine the # of clusters based on standard statistical approaches (e.g., maximum likelihood), which could be robust to outliers and noise These commonly used types of clustering algorithms serve well to fulfill the objective of biomedical research to extract knowledge from big data, and their applications in biomedical research are ubiquitous in the prevention, treatment, and prognosis of human diseases!

These algorithms allow us to explore the dataset at different granularity levels, which are also called connectivity-based algorithms that build clusters gradually. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering, also called bottom-up approach, starts from bottom with each data object placed individually in a separate group (i.e., n clusters). Then, it successively merges data objects or groups that are close to (i.e., similar to) one another. This repeats till all the groups are eventually merged into a single hierarchical cluster, which is the topmost level of the hierarchical tree. This merging process will continue until a certain stopping condition is valid Divisive hierarchical clustering, also called as top-down approach, begins from topmost level by placing all data objects in a single cluster, and every successive iteration will split a cluster into smaller clusters (i.e., subsets). This dividing process happens until eventually each data object is placed as a single cluster (i.e., n clusters at the bottommost level), or a certain stopping condition is valid Distance Measures (also called Dissimilairty Measures) in Hierarchical Clustering © Rui Xu, et al. 2010 Major Linkage Methods of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Single Linkage (also called Minimum Linkage) Complete Linkage (also called Maximum Linkage) Average Linkage [also called Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)] Centroid Linkage [also called Unweighted Pair Group Method with Centroid (UPGMC)] Ward’s Linkage (also called Minimum Variance) McQuitty Linkage [also called Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (WPGMA)] © Shaik Irfana Sultana; 2020[2] Advantages and Disadvantages of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and Divisive Hierarchical Clustering Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (A “bottom-up” approach) starts with n clusters, each of which includes exactly one data object. By comparison, divisive hierarchical clustering would start with considering 2(n-1) - 1 possible two-subset divisions for a cluster (a dataset) with data objects, which is very computationally intensive. Therefore, Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a often preferred and more widely used approach Divisive hierarchical clustering (A “top-down” approach) provides clearer insights into the main structure of a dataset, because the larger clusters are generated at the early stage of the clustering process, and are less likely to suffer from the accumulated erroneous decisions, which can not be corrected by the successive process Advantages They provide embedded flexibility regarding the level of granularity It is easier for them to handle a variety of distance measures They are applicable to any attribute types Disadvantages The stopping criteria can be very vague to determine (i.e., the # of clusters can be difficult to determine) Many hierarchical algorithms do not revisit the intermediate clusters once constructed, which hampers the purpose of their improvement PS: after calss challenges İzzet Tunç; 2021. Time serious data Clustring tslearn; Time Series Clusterin paper:NbClust: An R Package for Determining the Relevant Number of Clusters in a Data Set NbClust package provides 30 indices for determining the number of clusters and proposes to user the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods. L10 NbClust: NbClust Package for determining the best number of clusters L11 Partitional clustering Partitional clustering (also called partitioning-based clustering) algorithms identify the best K centers to partition the data objects into K clusters where the centers are either centroids (means), called K-means, or medoids, called K- medoids In contrast to hierarchical clustering, which yields a successive level of clusters by conducting either fusions or divisions, partitional clustering assigns a set of data objects into clusters with no hierarchical structure. The # of clusters, i.e., K, needs to be prespecified, and the choice of K is usually influenced by either prior knowledge regarding the nature of the data, or by using clustering validity measures. The K-means clustering algorithm is the best-known squared error-based clustering algorithm that has led to its applications in a variety of fields, e.g., psychology, marketing research, biology, and medicine K-Means Clustering First proposed by Steinhaus (1956) [Others suggest Forgy (1965)] [Steinhaus H. Sur la division des corp materiels en parties. Bull Acad Polon Sci. 1956; IV (C1.III), 801-804 has been cited 1,312 as of 02/22/2022, according to Google scholar; Forgy EW. Cluster analysis of multivariate data: efficiency versus interpretability of classifications. Biometrics 1965;21:768-9 has been cited 2,991 as of 02/22/2022, according to Google scholar] The K-means algorithm (also called kmeans algorithm) finds the centroids (i.e., centers) to minimize the sum of the squares of the Euclidean distance between each data point (i.e., each data object) and its closest centroid (i.e., center) In general, the K-means iterative clustering method is implemented as follows: Step 1: Choose a K value. Based on this value, randomly choose an initial set of K centroids Step 2: Assign each data object to the cluster with the nearest centroid Step 3: Determine the new set of K centroids for the K clusters, by computing the mean value of the cluster members - Step 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until there is no change in the criterion function (i.e., sum of squared error function) after an iteration (i.e., the algorithm converges) The K-means algorithm is relatively scalable and efficient for processing (i.e., clustering) large datasets. However, K-means can converge to a local optimum (rather than a global optimum) in a small # of iterations Iteration K-means clustering is a good place to start exploring an unlabeled dataset. The K in K-Means denotes the number of clusters. This algorithm is bound to converge to a solution after some iterations. It has 4 basic steps: Initialize Cluster Centroids (Choose those 3 books to start with) Assign datapoints to Clusters (Place remaining the books one by one) Update Cluster centroids (Start over with 3 different books) Repeat step 2–3 until the stopping condition is met. You don’t have to start with 3 clusters initially, but 2–3 is generally a good place to start, and update later on. © Azika Amelia; 2018; K-Means Clustering: From A to Z © Azika Amelia; 2018 Limitation It is sensitive to the densities, the size of the cluster. Advantages Is simple and can be easily implemented in solving many practical problems Can work very well for compact and hyperspherical clusters Can be used to cluster large datasets Disadvantages There is no efficient and universal method for identifying the initial partitions and the # of clusters, i.e., K. The convergence centroids vary with different initial points. A general strategy for the problem is to run the algorithm several times with random initial partitions The iterative optimization procedure of K-means cannot guarantee convergence to a global optimum. The stochastic optimization techniques, e.g., simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) can find the global optimum, but these tehniques are computationally intensive The K-means is sensitive to outliers and noise. E.g., even if a particular data object is quite far away from the cluster centroid, it is grouped into a cluster and, thus, could distort the cluster’s shape The definition of means limits the application only to numerical variables Example of the K-means cluster © Marcilio CP de Souto, et al. Advantages and Disadvantages of PAM Clustering Advantages PAM is more general than K-means [that typically require attributes (i.e., features) to be continuous], which can handle all types of attributes and all types of distance metrics (i.e., distance measures) Medoids (rather than centroids) are applied as the cluster “centers”, which are more robust and less sensitive to outliers and noise PAM can assist a user to determine the optimal # of clusters, i.e., K, because it provides a silhouette plot showing the silhouette widths for the K clusters Disadvantages The # of clusters, i.e., K, needs to be pre-specified, and the eventual clustering results are dependent on the initial selection of a random set of K data objects as K medoids The iterative optimization procedure of PAM cannot guarantee convergence to a global optimum PAM could be computationally intensive, which could work effectively for small datasets, but does not scale well for large datasets. To handle large datasets, a sampling-based method, called CLARA (Clustering LARge Applications), can be applied t-SNE t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten, 2008) is a state-of-the-art nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, that has emerged as a popular and powerful technique for the analysis of single-cell data generated by a wide variety of experimental platforms (e.g., Camp et al., 2017; See et al., 2017; Lavin et al., 2017) The t-SNE focuses on preserving the local structure while de-emphasizing the global structure of high-dimensional data, resulting in similar data points clustering together in an unsupervised manner. Because t-SNE allows the user to define the # of dimensions for analysis, cell populations can be unbiasedly shown in 2 or 3 dimensions For a high-dimensional dataset, t-SNE creates a low-dimensional distribution, or a ‘map’. Conspicuous groupings of data points, also called ‘islands’, correspond to observations that are similar in the original high-dimensional space, which help to visualize the general structure and heterogeneity of a dataset Exp: © Paul A.

During iteration, the successive base learners do not depend on earlier base learners (i.e., all are built independently),. Eventually, either a majority voting of predictions (for classification) or an averaging of predictions (for regression) is taken. Therefore, the diversity of individual learners is emphasized in Bagging algorithm, which has been increased implicitly for this ensemble learner Omics Cluster Analysis and Segmentation ↩︎ Shaik Irfana Sultana, 2020, How the Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Works; Dataaspirant ↩︎","link":"/2021/08/24/LearnNotes/tulane-bioinf-1/"},{"title":"Deep Learning (Classes notes)","text":"1 Lecture 18: Neural Networks 🐶 ANN, also called “artificial neural net” or “neural net”, represents one of the most popular and promising areas of artificial intelligence (AI) research.

In a multi-layer perceptron, it is used as the input value for another perceptron layer[2:1] Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm, also called multi-layer FFNN. An MLP comprises 3 layers: input, hidden, and output All neurons from one layer are fully connected to neurons in the adjacent layer. These connections are represented as weights. The weights play an important role in propagation of the signal in a neural network. The propagation which can be either single or multiple The learning algorithm of an MLP involves a forward feed (also called forward-propagation) step followed by a backpropagation (BP; also called backward-propagation) step, such that the input first is propagated through the neural network and the output computed. Then the error between the computer output and the correct output, in the form of a cost function, is propagated backward from the output to the input to adjust the weights (i.e., connection intensities). There are several methods that can be applied for backpropagation (BP), and among them, gradient descent method is the most popular Major Activation Functions in ANN What is Activation function: An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. This means that it will decide whether the neuron’s input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations. © V7 labs The steps of the ANN: input → weighted → Transform (Function) → Active (Function) Table: TizianoZarra; 2018 Activation Function Formula Strength/s Weakness/es Range Reference/s Logistic Sigmoid (LS) $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^ {-x}}$ • smooth • continuously differentiable possibility to get stuck in the training• slow convergence (0, 1) Rojas, 1996, Chen et al., 2015 Hyperbolic Tangent $f(x)=\\frac{1-e^ {-2x}}{1+e^ {-2x}}$ the derivative is more steep that LS (i.e., scaled LS) Differentiable at all points vanishing gradient issues and low gradient (−1, 1) Pushpa and Manimala, 2014, Theodoridis, 2015 Radial basis function or Gaussian Function $f(x)= exp(-\\frac{(x-c)^ 2}{r^ 2})$ • good when finer control is required over the activation range • computational time consuming due to the calculation of Euclidean distance (0, 1) Sibi et al., 2013; Faqih et al, 2017 Rectified Linear Unit Function (ReLU) $f(x)=0\\ for\\ x&lt;0;x\\ for\\ x ≥0$ • good estimator• can combine with other functions• can activate all neurons at the same time • non-differentiable at zero and unbounded.• it can create dead neurons because gradients for negative input are zero.

The gradient descent shall take many “epochs” (i.e., training cycles) to find the global cost minimum, rather than a local cost minimum, starting from an arbitrarily chosen initial weight[4]. Advantages and Disadvantages Advantages ANNs do not rely on data to be normally distributed, an assumption of classical parametric analysis methods ANNs are able to process data containing complex (non-linear) relationships and interactions that are often too difficult or complex to interpret by conventional linear methods ANNs are fault tolerant, i.e., they have the ability of handling noisy or fuzzy information, whilst also being able to endure data which is incomplete or contains missing values ANNs are capable of generalization, so they can interpret information which is different to that of the training data, thus representing a ‘real-world’ solution to a given problem by their ability to predict future cases or trends based on what they have previously seen. Disadvantages The ANN model obtained could be difficult to interpret Training of ANNs can potentially be time-consuming, depending on the complexity of the data being modelled As the # of hidden layers required to capture the features of the data increases, so does the time taken for training to complete. As such, only one or two hidden layers are commonly used. Overfitting may be a problem, which is a memorization of the training examples causing the ANN to perform poorly on future examples It is not always apparent how an ANN reaches a solution, and because of this, an ANN model has been referred to as a “black box” approach the quality of an ANN model ouput is highly dependent upon the quality of the input data Lecutre 19: Deep Learning Outliers Advanced Concepts in Neural Networks Cost Functions Activation Functions Learning Rates and Overfitting Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Parallelization Convolutional Neural Networks Recurrent Neural Networks What is Deep learning: Deep learning is a NN with &gt;1 hidden layer Loss Functions Which measures how well the model goes.

In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and errorJoseph M. Carew,. Reinforcement learning, also called neuro-dynamic programming and approximate dynamic programming [5][6], a goal-oriented algorithm, refers to a class of techniques for training a computational agent (also called controller, robot, or player) to successfully interact with the environment to attain specifically defined goals. As an agent takes actions within its environment, an iterative feedback looping of reward and state trains the agent during time to better accomplish the goals Reinforcement learning learns how to attain a complex objective or maximize along a particular dimension during many time steps. The key feature is that the agent operates in a delayed return (i.e., reward) environment, such that it is not obvious to understand which action leads to which result during many time steps. Thus, reinforcement learning aims at correlating immediate actions with the delayed returns produced by such actions General Reinforcement Learning Workflow In reinforcement learning (RL), the RL agent solves a sequential decision-making problem by learning new experiences through a trial-and-error approach. An RL agent is trained by its actions interacting with the environment to maximize the cumulative reward resulting from the interactions. Generally, An RL algorithm is modeled and solved based on the Markov decision process (MDP) theory [6:1], there is an R packege MDPtoolbox that can be applied to implement MDP The learning of an agent is a sequential process, where interactions with the environment occur at discrete time steps t = 0, 1, 2, …, such that in a typical RL iteration at time step t, the agent receives the environment’s state (i.e., st) and selects an action (at) to interact. The environment responds to the action at and progresses to a new state st+1 at next iteration at time step t+1 The reward rt+1 that the agent receives for the selected action at associated with the transition (st, at, st+1) is also determined [6:2]. Accordingly, after each RL iteration, the agent updates (state-)value function V(st) and action-value function Q(st, at) based on a control policy π, which is a function that maps st ∈ S to at ∈ A, i.e., π: S → A ⇒ at = π(st) [7] The objective of the RL agent is to iteratively learn (i.e., attain) an optimal control policy π* that maximizes the expected umulative reward (i.e., expected return) received Deep Reinforcement Learning © Luis Campos; 2018 Zafeiris D, Rutella S, Ball GR.

(For example, when the width of the parent population reflects actual variation of the measured quantity more than in reflects experimental uncertainty) Does not decrease with more measurements Should be used when the width of the parent distribution is important to your audience. SEM Describes the uncertainty in the measured value of the mean Decreases with more measurements Should be used when the accuracy in the measured mean is more important to your audience that the width of the parent population. (For example, when most of the width of the parent population is due to experimental uncertainties) Always give the sample size so your reader can convert Rules for expressing means and uncertainties Express your data with the last significant digit equal to the precision of your measurement. Plot a histogram to see the distribution. Also test whether your data are distributed in a Gaussian manner. Present uncertainties as standard deviations if the width of the parent population is important or standard errors if the precision of the measured mean is important. Always define error (SD, SEM) and provide sample number so readers can convert. Keep in mind that experiments with small sample sizes are much more variable and have higher uncertainties. Lecture 3 The t-table The t distribution is a probability distribution that we can use to express confidence intervals of a mean. $$ t_ i = \\frac{\\overline{X_ i} - \\mu_ {parent}}{σ/\\sqrt{N}} $$ Interpretation: The deviation of sample mean and parent mean divided by SEM T Distributuin For analyze statistical data from small sample.

For retrieve the rows of the T table: Rows = N -1!!! That’s means, when your sample size is 4, you should looking into row 3! T table related examples: dummies.com Confidence Interval (CI) = ±t × SEM The Confidence Interval (CI) is the range of possible means over which there is a specified probability of observing a similarly measured value. CI is another way of expressing the uncertainty in a mean. To calculate a confidence interval (CI): Choose what confidence level you want (95% is typical) p is the probability. Equals 1-confidence level. 95% mean p=0.05 Determine the t-value (t*) from a t-table using dF and p Calculate CI using the equation above When you express a CI, make sure the readers knows probability and N Example: You measured 8.72 ± 1.21 (SD, N=7) . What is the 99% CI? Calculate $SE = SD/\\sqrt7$ = 0.46 Determine t (for p=0.01 and dF=6) t= 3.71 (t-table) in r: X= 0.01; N = 7qt(X/2, df = N-1, lower.tail = F)[1] 3.707428 Calculate CI = t*SE = 3.17*0.48 = 1.78 One sided (one tailed) versus two-sided confidence intervals © Sunil Ray; 2015 Two tailed probabilities are almost always better than one-tailed probabilities because they are more conservative (less likely to lead you to mistakenly claim a positive correlation) and because they do not require any assumption about the sign of the deviation between the actual and measured value. For symmetrical distributions (Gaussian, t-distribution, etc) the two-tailed probability is twice the one-tailed probability. Divide probability in a t-table by 2 to convert two-tailed to one-tailed. Multiple probability by 2 to covert one-tailed to two-tailed. The p-value The null hypothesis (Ho) is a hypothetical value of the mean of the parent population. Typically it is the value you would expect to observe if the parameter or conditions of interest have no effect on your measured parameter. Statistical tests are used to support or disprove the null hypothesis. The p-value is the probability that you have obtained a difference between your results and the null hypothesis as large as you did observe strictly by chance. In other words, it is the probability of obtaining obtained your results if the null hypothesis was true. Confidence Intervals and p-values are connected α is the cutoff that we chose for statistical significance. The ends of the 1-α CI define the values of the null hypothesis that fall exactly at p=α. A CI defines the range of hypothetical values that have probabilities larger than α, and thus are not significant. Values outside the confidence interval have p-values smaller than α and thus are significant. $t = \\frac{|(H_0 - μ)|}{SE}$ $t = |(H_ 0 -μ)|\\sqrt{N}/ sd$ $sd = |(H_ 0 -μ)|\\sqrt{N}/t $ $sd = |(0 - )|$ Examples: Mesurement: 1.235, 2.1254, 3.8926, 1.0022, 0.9880, 2.9876, 1.4350 Your null hypothesis is that the enzyme expression is 1.0.

Your measurement is not significantly different from the null hypothesis. Assumptions before t-test: The parent population has a normal (Gaussian) distribution Your sample is a random sampling of the population Lecture 4: The p-value The p-value is the probability that you have obtained a difference between your results and the null hypothesis as large as you did observe strictly by chance. In other words, due to random sampling. The p-value is the probability of obtaining your results if the null hypothesis was true. The One Sample t-test The simplest (and most useful) statistical test is the one-sample t-test which compares a mean from set of measurements to a hypothetical value (the null hypothesis). The one sample t-test calculates a probability (p-value) that the null hypothesis is true, and that you measured a value as far away from it as yours simply by chance. Example data: 7,11,3,5,12,3,0,8 μ = 6.25; σ = 4.0; N = 8; 95% CI = 2.9 to 9.6 Null Hypothesis is that the value = 0 Our statistical test: Two tailed p-value = 0.0029 (very significant). If the parent mean is 0, there is a 0.29% chance of measuring a mean of 6.25 ± 4.0 (SD, N=8). The sample you measured probably does not have a parent mean of 0. The null hypothesis is disproved. Now assume that the Null Hypothesis be that the value = 3 Our statistical test: Two tailed p-value = 0.053 (Not significant at the 95% level) If the parent mean is 3, there is a 5.3% chance of measuring a mean of 6.25 ± 4.0 by chance. You have no reason to conclude that the parent mean is not 3. The null hypothesis is NOT disproved. Exp in R: Ps, I tried running the codes but keep get a sliter different result. The main reason is the mean and sd not match the example data. So, I dicided to change the 0 to 1.

A “before and after” experiment is unpaired if the identity of the individual samples is not maintained or if both sets of measurements are independent samplings of a parent population.

The difference is dromatic. According to the result above, μA = 35.5, μB = 55.2. In R, we can also using this test to test that the B is larget than A: Codes P value t.test(A,B, mu= 0, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 1 t.test(A,B, mu= -10, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.999 t.test(A,B, mu= -20, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.4546 t.test(A,B, mu= -21, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.3111 t.test(A,B, mu= -23, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.1107 t.test(A,B, mu= -24, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.05872 t.test(A,B, mu= -25, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) 0.02937 According to the result above, we can “safly” say that B is greater A than 24. Two sample t-test: paired A paired experiment is one in which there are multiple measurements of the same sample/subject or on matched (unique) samples/subjects. This can be a “before and after” experiment, or an experiments on manually selected matched samples (experiment and control). Paired sample experiments are more sensitive that unpaired experiments. Paired experiments DO NOT require that the samples be Gaussian as long as the differences (pairwise) are Gaussian. We still using the data A, B above t.test(A, B, paired = T) Paired t-test data: A and B t = -6.9072, df = 9, p-value = 7.01e-05 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -26.15189 -13.24811 sample estimates: mean of the differences -19.7 Compare the results from one sample t test: t.test(A-B) One Sample t-test data: A - B t = -6.9072, df = 9, p-value = 7.01e-05 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -26.15189 -13.24811 sample estimates: mean of x -19.7 We can find that: The Paired T test is actually running one sample t test with the difference of paired lists T test from statistic results function tsum.test from BSDA: tsum.test( mean.x, s.x = NULL, n.x = NULL, mean.y = NULL, s.y = NULL, n.y = NULL, alternative = \"two.sided\", mu = 0, var.equal = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95 ) Instead of give two lists, we given the Mean, Sd, and N (sample size) to do the t-test.

This makes a non-parametric test weaker than a t-test, because the information contained in the shape of the distribution is not used in a non- Parametric test. But, if the data are strongly non-Gaussian and you can not transform The data to make it Gaussian, then you may not have a choice. one sample versus a null hypothesis Sign Test A sign test is used to decide whether a binomial distribution has the equal chance of success and failure. For number of successes = 5, number of trials = 18, : binom.test(5, 18) [1] Mann Whitney test. Two data samples are independent if they come from distinct populations and the samples do not affect each other. Using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test, we can decide whether the population distributions are identical without assuming them to follow the normal distribution. wilcox.test(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)[2] Pythonfrom scipy.stats import mannwhitneyumales = [19, 22, 16, 29, 24]females = [20, 11, 17, 12]U1, p = mannwhitneyu(males, females)print(p) 0.055673443266570206 For unpaired data: Randomization test (See the codes below) It is a test used to analyze the distribution of a set of data to see if it can be described as random (patternless)(wikipedia) Mann Whitney test (See the codes above) For paired data: Wilcoxon (signed rank) test The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests the null hypothesis that two related paired samples come from the same distribution. In particular, it tests whether the distribution of the differences x - y is symmetric about zero. It is a non-parametric version of the paired T-test.from scipy.stats import wilcoxond = [6, 8, 14, 16, 23, 24, 28, 29, 41, -48, 49, 56, 60, -67, 75]w, p = wilcoxon(d)w, p (24.0, 0.041259765625) There are MANY non-parametric tests. These above use nothing more than the actual data collected. The data are scrambled between columns randomly and all the possible outcomes are generated. The p-value is calculated from the probability of an outcome as large or larger than the one observed. The randomization test uses the actual values. Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon use only the rank of each value (highest, lowest etc) and thus are not sensitive to extreme values.

According to this website, we need two parameter to find the outliers. One is Dmax, the second is Z-score. $Pr(Z&gt;D_ {max}) = \\frac{1}{4n}$ which in r is: qnorm(1/4/N), N is the sample size. So, we can easily define a function like this: chauvenet_test &lt;- function(A){ Dmax = abs(qnorm(1/4/length(A))) Outer = A[abs(scale(A))&gt;= abs(Dmax)] Z_out = abs(scale(A))[abs(scale(A))&gt;= abs(Dmax)] P_val = 1- pnorm(abs(scale(A)), lower.tail = T) print(paste(&quot;Dmax:&quot;, Dmax)) print(paste(&quot;Outliners:&quot;,Outer)) print(paste(&quot;Zscore:&quot;, Z_out)) print(paste(&quot;P value:&quot;, P_val)) return(Outer)} We measure 17, 23, 41, 19, 29, 34, 99 in a new type of experiment. You are suspicious of the measurement of 99. You want to know if you can reject any points. 37.43 ± 28.44(SD, N=7) 99 is 2.17 standard deviations from the mean (Z-scores) The p-value is 0.0152, and 0.0152×7=0.1064 As we calculated below, μ = 37.43, σ = 28.44, Z = 2.17. The probability of Z according from the Z table is 0.015, which means if the cut threshold is 0.05 or 0.03, 99 should be rejected. When the cut threshold is 0.01, then, 99 should be accepted. On the other hand, the P value of 17 is 0.76, which is acceptable.

In other words, dx/du is a measure of how much x changes when u changes. This equation can be applied to any equation in which x is a function of U and v. The last term in the equation above is the covariance which becomes significant only if the uncertainties in the parameters are correlated. Most of the time, the covariance can be ignored.

The criteria for “best” linear fit is the line that gives the minimum sum of errors squared: $$ SSE = \\sum{(Y_ i - Pred_ i)^ 2} $$ Where Yi is the y-value of the Xi,Yi pair and Predi is the predicted value of the line at Xi. Linear Regression I In Linear Regression, you assume that there is a Independent variable (X) that you control, or select and a Dependent variable that you measures. They are related by the equation=mX +b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept at (X=0) You assume that all of the uncertainty (scatter) is in Y (not X). Types of Uncertainties: Equal uncertainties (assumed by most programs) Proportional uncertainties Counted uncertainties Individual uncertainties Uncertainties in Y and X Linear regression is based on a Chi-squared calculation that finds the “best fit” line which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and expected values of Y for each value of X. Because the expected differences depend on the uncertainties in Y, we must first define the uncertainties (or weighting factors) si for each Y There are several possibilities: Uncertainties in Y are all equal. This is the default assumption of most linear regression calculators,websites etc. Generally valid if each point is a single measurement using a technique that gives a constant absolute uncertainty. In this case, you can estimate s and use it as the weighting factor, or get it from the regression analysis. In the case of equal uncertainties, the important results of the linear regression analysis will not change if you enter the actual values. So you can ignore the actual uncertainties if they are equal. Uncertainties are a constant proportion of the Y-value. In this case multiply Y by the relative uncertainty to get uncertainty in Y. Y is a counted variable or a proportion of counted variables Count: $σ=\\sqrt{x}$ x = number of events Proportion: $σ=\\sqrt{np(1-p)}$ $n=total\\ event$ $p=\\frac{x}{n}$ Uncertainties in Y are unique for each value. Each Y may be an average with a mean and uncertainty of its own. Or different measurement methods may have been used for different sets of points. In this case use the appropriate uncertainty for each point. If your uncertainties are not constant, you must use curve fitting (non-linear regression) to fit an equation for a line to your data. When using curve-fitting you can weight each point by its SD. Linear Regression Function $$ Y = mX +b $$ $slop=\\frac{\\sum{\\frac{x_ i^ 2}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{y_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} - \\sum{\\frac{x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{y_ i x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} }{ \\sum{\\frac{x_ i^ 2}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{1}{σ_ i^ 2}} - (\\sum{\\frac{x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}})^ 2 }$ $intercept=\\frac{\\sum{\\frac{1}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{y_ i x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} - \\sum{\\frac{x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{y_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}} }{ \\sum{\\frac{x_ i^ 2}{σ_ i^ 2}} \\sum{\\frac{1}{σ_ i^ 2}} - (\\sum{\\frac{x_ i}{σ_ i^ 2}})^ 2 }$ Calculating p-values from Linear Regression The Null hypothesis for Linear Regression is that X and Y are not correlated. In other words: A change in X will not produce a predictable change in Y. The observed changes in Y are due to random error. p-values are calculated using the Chi Squared test. “Observed” is the measured value of Y at a particular X “Expected” is the value of the line at a particular X $$ χ^ 2 = \\sum{\\frac{expected - observed}{σ^ 2}}^ 2 $$ $$ df = N - 2 $$ Also individual p-values for the slope and intercept (compared to a null hypothesis, usually zero) can be calculated using a one sample t-test with the value of the slope or intercept and its standard error. Use N-2 as the degrees of freedom. Once we have the χ2, we can have the p-value by pchisq(x, df=2, lower.tail=FALSE), which x is the χ2. What else can you say about a linear regression analysis? Errors If your estimate of the uncertainties is too large, and you use them to do Linear Regression then the χ2 will be too small and the p-value will be close to 1.0. The calculated S value will be smaller that your estimates of SD in the data points. Correct uncertainties will follow the Z-distribution around the line. In other words roughly 67% of the ± 1 SD error bars on each Y value will include the best fit line, 33% will not include the line. This is because 1 SD is essentially a 67% Confidence interval. Residuals The distribution of residual errors is an indication of the goodness of fit. They should be randomly distributed. Correlation Coefficient $$ r^ 2 = \\frac{total\\ variance\\ in\\ Y - variance\\ in\\ Y\\ from\\ regression }{ total\\ variance } $$ $$ r^ 2 = \\frac{\\sum{(y_ i - y_ {mean})^ 2} - \\sum{(y_ i - y_ {expected})^ 2} }{ \\sum{(y_ i - y_ {mean})^ 2} } $$ r2 = 1 means perfect correlation. r2 = 0 mean there is no correlation. Note that some programs give r (not r2) which can range from –1 to +1 Extrapolation You can use regression parameters to calculate a new value of Y for any value of X. But beyond the range of the actual data, the calculated values can become very uncertain. Below: 95% confidence interval from Instat. Assumptions of linear regression Linear regression assumes that the X and Y numbers are independent measurements. Y can depend on X, but it can not contain the same data as X. If the values of X and Y are both used to calculate one or the other, then the observed correlation will be false. In the example above blood pressure in patients before and after a treatment are plotted. These are independent measurements, until you decide to see if there is a correlation between the change in blood pressure and the value before treatment. The change is really X – Y, so the Y axis values on the right are calculated using X. Since the numerical value of X is part of the Y axis AND the X axis, you can get a false correlation between X and Y. L17: Biomedical Statistics and Data Analysis Runs test The Wald–Wolfowitz runs test (or simply runs test), named after statisticians Abraham Wald and Jacob Wolfowitz is a non-parametric statistical test that checks a randomness hypothesis for a two-valued data sequence. More precisely, it can be used to test the hypothesis that the elements of the sequence are mutually independent. wikipedia Reference: Runs-test The runs test made by Prism is it assign the elements into two groups and calculate only the “lesser” part of the result. There are three packages we can do runs test: DescTools, snpar, and randtests. Only the DescTools has the same result like Prism by code below. TMP is the vector which contain the re-assign result as we talked above. For this package, you can assign the different group either to number or Character.

Count Variable For an event to be counted it has to occur AND it has to be observed. Counted variables are treated differently than measured variables because their distributions are asymmetric (not Gaussian). (use binomial statistics) To be able to apply the statistical treatments that we will use, the counted events must follow the following rules: Each event has a probability of occurring or a random probability of being observed (or both). Occurrence or observation (or both) is a random event. The probability of occurrence/observation is independent of whether other occurrences/observations have been made. If both the occurrence of an event and its observation are non random or known with certainty then the statistical principles related to counted variables do not apply. Examples Examples of counted variables where the occurrence is random but the observation is certain: Proportion of planes that crash Number of cars that drive past a certain intersection Number of patients that die when treated with a drug Examples of counted variables where the occurrence is certain but the observation is random: Number of turtles counted in a lake Radioisotope concentration Examples of counted variables where both occurrence and observation is random: Number of people with the flu Number of cells that are transfected Examples of counted variables where neither the occurrence nor the observation is random: The number of turtles in a bathtub The number of toes on your left foot The number of presidents with wives named “Barbara” Question: Are you categorizing or just counting events (or categorizing)? If you are categorizing events (yes/no, live/dead, success/failure, democrat/republican) use binomial statistics. INSTAT does not deal with single proportions very well. OS4 and SSP will use do calculations for proportions. SSP uses the word “probability” to denote proportions. If you are counting events Car crashes, weddings in July, deaths from lung cancer, radioactive counts) use Poisson statistics.

So as the H2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 The binomial distribution is used to describe small numbers of discreet events, or proportions of small numbers. Becomes a Gaussian distribution as n gets large. Mean and standard deviation of the parent distribution can be calculated. $μ= np$ μ is the mean number of “successes”, n is the number of trials p is the probability of success in each trial $σ_ μ = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$ The standard deviation in μ (# successes) If p is not known it must be estimated from the data. p is successes divided by total i.e. (μ/n) Data that would use a Binomial Distribution Example: You know that normally 1 person in 8 has a negative reaction to a particular drug. 1. How many negative reactions would you expect to have in a sample of 21 people? In this questions, we can know that the p = 1/8 So, we can have $\\mu = np= 21\\times (1/8) = 2.63$ We supposed have 2.63 people is negative And then: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}= \\sqrt{21 × (1/8)(7/8)} = 1.52$ The SD is 1.52 2. What is the probability of observing zero negative reactions in 21 patients? dbinom(0, 21, 1/8) [1] 0.06055766 Example: You conducted a random phone poll of 900 people and found that 45% favored candidate A and 55% favored candidate B. What is the uncertainty of the result (What is the standard deviation?). This question is actually calling for the relative uncertainty. which is μ/σ $µ=np=900×.45= 405$ $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}=\\sqrt{900×0.45(1-0.45)}=14.92481$ Relative uncertainty = μ/σ = 3.7% The Poisson Distribution When p « 1 or when n » x the binomial distribution simplifies to the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution also applies when you are counting discreet events (presumably from a very large population of possible observations) but not categorizing them as successes/failures or left/right or alive/dead or sick/not sick. $$ p = \\frac{\\mu^ x}{x!}e^{-\\mu} $$ $\\mu=np=x$ $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$; When the p « 1, we then have: $σ = \\sqrt{np}= \\sqrt{x}$ The standard deviation of a counted variable is the square root of the # of counts. Ex: Political polls, radioactive counts, cell counts etc Special case: If the probability of seeing an event is 1/n and you try n times, the probability of seeing the event once is only 37%. This is exactly the same as the probability of not seeing the event at all. There is a 63% chance is seeing it at least once. Binomial versus Poisson Statistics: Which do we use? Finally: The binomial equation is used when counting ratios or proportions of small numbers ( i.e. n/m where n&lt; 100, n&lt;m and m&lt;100). If we were counting the number cars that drive up to an intersection, that would be described with a Poisson distribution. While counting the number that turn left relative to the total would normally be described with a binomial distribution. The binomial equation is used when categorizing. In other words, when your data are ratios or proportions of counted variables. The Poisson equation is used when counting only and not categorizing. When the numerator of a ratio is very large, the binomial and Poission descriptions become equivalent. Examples: If we were counting the number cars that pass a certain intersection, that would be described with a Poisson distribution, because it is a simple count. If we are counting the number of cars that hat turn left and the number that turn right, that would be described with a binomial distribution because it is a categorization. Assume you are doing yeast genetic studies and are counting the number of transformed colonies. If the transformation is frequent, you can plate a small number of colonies (&lt;1000), count transformed and normal colonies, and analyze the statistics using proportions (binomial). If the transformation is rare, you can plate thousands of colonies, count only the transformed colonies and analkyze the statistics using simple counts (Poisson). L9: Confidence intervals for proportions and counts How to determine statistical significance of one proportion versus a null hypothesis: Determine the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval. Use 1-α for probability. 95% CI for α=0.05. Compare H0 to the CI. If Ho is inside the CI, the difference is not significant. If H0 is outside the CI, the difference IS significant. How to calculate the 95% confidence Intervals. R codes: Wayne W. LaMorte, MD, PhD, MPH prop.test(10,20,p=.5) 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction data: 10 out of 20, null probability 0.5 X-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value = 1 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.299298 0.700702 sample estimates: p 0.5 library(Hmisc)#calculate 95% confidence intervalbinconf(x=10, n=20, alpha=.05) PointEst Lower Upper 0.5 0.299298 0.700702 Results from Exact Binomial and Poisson Confidence Intervals : Special case for a proportion: How do you determine p-value when the Null hypothesis is 0 or 1? There is a problem we have to solve: The exact two-sided CI (by definition) can never include a proportion of 0 or 1 (because we are forcing it to have equal area on each side). Yet, in some cases the probability of observing a proportion of exactly zero 0 or 1 will be greater than 0.025 (half of the 95% CI) and thus should not be considered significant. How do we decide if a null hypothesis proportion of 0 or 1 is really statistically different from a experimentally derived proportion? There are two approaches. Exact Solution: Go to a binomial probability calculator and calculate the probability for x=0 (or x=n) for your proportion. If p&gt;0.025 then the limit (proportion = 0 or 1) should be considered WITHIN the CI and not significantly different. Approximate solution (works well for trials &gt; 10): Determine the 2 sided CI of your proportion. If the 1/n is within the CI, then a proportion of 0 is NOT statistically significant. If (x-1)/x is within the CI then a proportion of 1 is NOT statistically significant. HINT: For any experiment with at least 12 trials, if the successes = 3 or less, it will not be statistically different from a proportion of zero. Similarly, if the number of trials is 12 or more and trials-successes = 3 or less, it will never be significantly different from a proportion of 1. Example: You measured a proportion of 3/15. Is there a statistically significant difference from a Null hypothesis proportion = 0? Using the statpages site or table above the CI of the proportion 3/15 is 0.043 – 0.481. Exact method: Using a binomial calculator (above) with N=15 and prop = 0.2 (3/15), the probability of x=0 is 0.0352. Since this is larger than the one-tailed probability of 0.025 (for =0.05) it is NOT significant. Approximate Method: The value 1/n or 1/15 is 0.067. Since this value falls within the CI 0.043-0.481, a proportion of 0 is NOT significantly different from your measured 3/15. So, after interpretation from above, we now know that we’d like to know the difference between 3/15 and 0/15. So, the code in R could be: prop.test(0,15, p = 3/15) 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction data: 0 out of 15, null probability 3/15 X-squared = 2.6042, df = 1, p-value = 0.1066 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.2 95 percent confidence interval: 0.0000000 0.2534679 sample estimates: p 0 p-value = 0.1066, which means is not significantly different. The null hypothesis is accepted and 3/15 has no difference from 0/15. Confidence Interval of a Poisson distributed (counted) value How do you determine statistical significance for the null hypothesis that a proportion equals a certain value? A 95% CI is equal to p- value of 0.05. Calculate a CI for the proportion using one of the methods we just discussed. If CI includes the null hypothesis, then p is larger than your cutoff (thus not significant). If the CI does not include the null hypothesis p is smaller and is significant. Example: Suppose you observed 5 mice out of 30 transgenic mouse offspring were male. You wanted to know if there was a gender specific mortality effect. Your null hypothesis is 0.5 (half male, half female). Observed Ratio = 0.17 95% CI = 0.056-0.347 (From Table) Since the 95% CI does not include Null hypothesis, p is smaller than 0.05 and is significant. In r, We know that the observe is 5, sample size is 30, and expectation is 0.5. So, we can have: prop.test(5,30,.5) 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction data: 5 out of 30, null probability 0.5 X-squared = 12.033, df = 1, p-value = 0.0005226 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.06303555 0.35451084 sample estimates: p 0.1666667 We can see that the p = 0.0005226, which means the result is significant. Example: Poisson Confidence Intervals A newspaper headline proclaims that the roads in Southern Louisiana have become less safe in 2004 because the 138 fatal accidents that year was 11% higher than the long term average number of 124 per year. Use statistics to analyze this conclusion. Are the roads more dangerous? Since 124 is a long term average we use it in this simple example as a null hypothesis without uncertainty. In r, we just need use: poisson.test(138) Exact Poisson test data: 138 time base: 1 number of events = 138, time base = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true event rate is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 115.9369 163.0397 sample estimates: event rate 138 We can see that the confidence interval is from 115.9369 to 163.0397. And 115.9369 &lt; 124 &lt; 163.0397. So, the result is not significant difference. More examples for understanding Example 1: If your data are the proportion of dead cells on a plate and you measured in each of four fields: 31/120; 18/56; 40/103; 44/121 You recalculate your total proportion as (31+18+40+44) / (120+56+103+121) or 133/400. We use 1-sample proportions: prop.test(133, 400) the CI: 0.2869229 0.3813495 the proportion of 4 experiments are: 0.2583333, 0.3214286, 0.3883495, 0.3636364. The first experiment is significantly different from others. Example 2: Your Geiger counter reports counts in 1 minute intervals: 12,15,8,17,12,11,9 and 13 Your confidence interval is based on total counts = 97 (12.1 cpm) poisson.test(97) tell us that the CI is: 78.66047 118.33177, which means it’s 9.832558 14.791472 per minute. We can find that the 8 and 9 is the outlier. L10: Contingency Tables It is used in statistics to summarize the relationship between several categorical variables. A contingency table is a special type of frequency distribution table, where two variables are shown simultaneously. Instruction in Excel Clinical studies sometimes use a binary (yes/no) decision to assess disease or outcome. So clinical studies are often analyzed as a proportion of a counted variable. There are four main types of clinical studies: Retrospective (case-control): Start with outcome (e.g. disease) and look back to see the cause with cases (disease) and controls (no disease). Prospective: Start with exposure and follow cases to see if disease develops. Also uses cases (exposed or hypothetical risk factor) and controls (not exposed, or no hypothetical risk factor). Cross-sectional: Start with a set of randomly selected subjects that are NOT selected based disease or exposure. Divide into two groups and assess the correlation between disease and hypothetical risk factor. Experimental: Randomly selected subjects, Split into two groups, subject one groups to a treatment, the other to a control treatment such as a placebo. Find the correlated with the diseases. Exp1: How you compare multiple proportions with one another? Imagine a small scale experimental cancer drug trial. You recruit 40 patients with end-stage cancer. 20 get drug and 8 of them survive 5 years. Another 20 get placebo and 2 of them survive 5 years. contingency table Survival Not Survival Treated 8 12 Not Treated 2 18 Codes for R: December 19, 2020 by George Pipis in R bloggers TB2 &lt;- data.frame( Survival = c(8, 2), Dead=c(12, 18), row.names = c(&quot;Treated&quot;, &quot;Placebo&quot;))prop.table(TB2)chisq.test(TB2)fisher.test(TB2) Survival Dead Treated 0.20 0.30 Placebo 0.05 0.45 Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction data: TB2 X-squared = 3.3333, df = 1, p-value = 0.06789 Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: TB2 p-value = 0.06483 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 0.9222194 64.6794654 sample estimates: odds ratio 5.735024 We can see that P value from both Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact test are larger than 0.05, which means the null hypothesis is accepted and they have no significant difference. Exp 2: An example of a clinical trial with a single outcome Suppose you are performing an experimental study to determine if AZT improves the outcome of HIV-infected patients. All patients are infected with HIV, some are treated with AZT some with placebo. You determine which patients develop clinical symptoms of AIDS and which do not.

Explained: If you want to measure the confidence interval for the difference between the proportions. You can do it with a Gaussian approximation if none of the entries are smaller than 5 and none of the same-row values are within 5 of each other. (In other words, if neither proportion is close to zero or close to 1.0). $$ CI = (p_ 1 - p_ 2) ± z × \\sqrt{\\frac{p_ 1 (1-p_ 1)}{n_ 1} + \\frac{p_ 2 (1-p_ 2)}{n_ 2}} $$ Other ways of expressing proportional results: Relative risk(RR) $$ RR = \\frac{p_ 1}{p_ 2} $$ Relative risk is sometimes called relative rate or relative probability, especially in non-clinical studies. Pay attention to which outcome is in the numerator (on top). In the AZT study, the relative risk is 0.57. AZT patients were 57% as likely as placebo patients to have disease progression. If we switched places of the two treatments (which would be perfectly valid) we would be saying that placebo patients were 1.75 time as likely to have disease progression. Number Needed to Treat $$ NNT = \\frac{1}{(p_ 2 - p_ 1)} $$ Odds ratio (OR) $$ OR = (\\frac{Odds_ 1}{Odds_ 2}= \\frac{TD/TN}{ND/NN}) $$ Exp 3 Cat scratch fever is a mild disease that is transmitted by cats.

Example: You have measured 2.3±5.0 (SD, n=26) and determined that p=0.027 for Ho=0. What is the power of your experiment? Mean=2.3, H0= 0, as a result, delta = 2.3-0 =2.3. Because the null hypothesis is 0, we only need the lesser side. So, we should use one.sample t test. In R, we can have: power.t.test(n = 40, delta = 2.3, sd = 5, type=&quot;one.sample&quot;, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) One-sample t test power calculation n = 40 delta = 2.3 sd = 5 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.8097611 alternative = two.sided We can tell that the power is 0.81, which means you got 80.98% of chance to have the significant result. With the same data, if we’d like to improve the changes to 95%, than, we can have: power.t.test(power = .95, delta = 2.3, sd = 5, type=&quot;one.sample&quot;, alternativ = &quot;two.sided&quot;) One-sample t test power calculation n = 63.36733 delta = 2.3 sd = 5 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.95 alternative = two.sided Now, we can know that we need at least 64 tests to get a significant result with the chance of 95% in success. Example 1: In a preliminary experiment you measure 12±4 (SD). You want to estimate sample size required to detect a difference of ±0.5 (Ho – mean) with a power of 90%. The confidence level you will use is 95% (α=0.05) Two-sample t test power calculation n = 1345.911 delta = 0.5 sd = 4 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.9 alternative = two.sided Example 2: If around 10% of the population suffers from migraine headaches. How many people would you have to enroll in an experimental clinical study to determine if prophylactic daily aspirin use will reduce the number of people who have migraines to 8%. Your desired confidence level is 95% and the desired power is 50%. power.prop.test(p1=.1, p2 = .08, power = .5) Two-sample comparison of proportions power calculation n = 1573.077 p1 = 0.1 p2 = 0.08 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.5 alternative = two.sided We know that with the power of 0.5, we need to at least have 1574 sample for each. So, for a test with control, we’d like to have at least 1574*2=3148 for the experiment.","link":"/2022/03/30/LearnNotes/tulane-biostat-2/"},{"title":"1 Methods in Biology|Advanced Cell Biology|Tulane","text":"Co-Author: Haoyang liang Cell Biology Methods Comment Methods: Immunohistochemistry-immunofluorescence Western blotting Immunoprecipitation Southern blotting Northern blotting in suit hybridization allele-specific oligonucleotides DNA microarray Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA sequencing Immunohistochemistry-immunofluorescence Fixation:(antigen denaturation) Formalin: kill and cell fixation Paraffin: paraffin-embedded tissue section Antigen retrieval Antigen retrieval is an effective method of unmasking antigenic epitopes on the surface of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.

This variation can create or destroy restriction enzyme sites. Structural alteration in the gene or flanking sequences Linkage Clues to the location of a gene can come from comparing the inheritance of a mutant gene with the inheritance of markers of a known chromosomal location within a family Coinheritance, or genetic linkage, of a disease gene and a marker suggests that they are physically close together on the chromosome Linkage is determined by analyzing the pattern of inheritance of a gene and a marker in suitable families Because the RFLP is inherited just like a gene the individual chromosomes can be followed as they pass from generation to generation by tracing the inheritance of the marker fragments Variable Number of Tandem Repeats A hypervariable locus that consists of a variable number of identical sequences joined together in tandem. There are many VNTR loci in the genome; therefore, the pattern of fragments from the VNTR loci in one individual is essentially unique for that individual. When DNA is digested with a restriction endonuclease that cuts the sequence flanking a VNTR locus, the lengths of the DNA fragments produced in different individuals depend on the number of repeats at the locus - a DNA fingerprint DNA Fingerprinting Analyses of a set of polymorphic loci that are chosen so that the probability that two individual DNA samples with identical haplotypes could by chance have come from two different individuals is low. The most useful polymorphisms for this purpose occur at hypervariable loci. Allele Specific Oligonucleotide Hybridization Oligonucleotide probes are used that hybridize selectively to the normal or the mutant allele. These allele-specific probes can be used for any disorder where the nucleotide sequence of the mutant and normal alleles are known. Example: cystic fibrosis The ASO hybridization method exploits selective hybridization to distinguish between the normal and mutant alleles DNA Chip Technology Miniaturized silicone chips with densely packed arrays of oligonucleotides have been developed. The chips can be hybridized to a fluorescently labeled sample. Laser scanning of the chip can detect localized areas of fluorescence. DNA Microarray: The Genome Project made available cDNA clones and DNA sequences representing the entire genome Robotics allows precise immobilization of DNA onto microarrays Well-developed knowledge of nucleic acid hybridization Computer-based bioinformatics to analyze massive amount of data. In most instances cluster analyses of microarrays confirms pathological classification and staging, but new tumor entities have also been revealed. Response to chemotherapy has been predicted by the expression profile. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spetrometry is a complementary means to analyze the proteome. Target amplified nucleic acid-based techniques couple hybridization with target nucleic acid and signal amplification techniques. The assays require exacting assay conditions (i.e. control for molecular contamination of reactions by amplified products leading to false positive results and using quality assurance measures and experimental controls that are carefully designed and executed) and careful interpretation.","link":"/2021/08/24/LearnNotes/tulane-cellbio-1/"},{"title":"10 Cell Signaling|Advanced Cell Biology|Tulane","text":"Cell’s social network No cell lives in isolation; life requires that all cells sense chemical and physical stimuli in their environment and respond which changes that can affect their function os development. – Molecule Cell Biology, 3ed Inner signals Toxic signals Physical signals Responding to other biologies Growth factors Hormones Neurotransmitters Morphogens Odors Pheromones Ions Pharmacological agents Chemicals Heavy Metals Light Temperature Pressure Radiation Viruses Bacteria Responding of the cell signaling: differentiation proliferation exocytosis migration apoptosis adhesion senescence Receptors: Three domains: Extracellular domain plasma-membrane-spanning domain intracellular domain Acts like a ligand Many signaling proteins are belongs to signal transduction proteins Transmembrane signaling: only a few mechanisms Ligand-gated ion channel (iontropic receptros) G-protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic) Kinases-linked receptors Nuclear receptors Signal Transduction Snthesis → Release → Transport → Detection → Initiation → Functional Change → Deactivation → Removal Synthesis of the signal Release of the signaling molecule by the signaling cell: exocytosis, diffusion, cell-cell contact Transport of the signal to the target cell Detection of the signal by a specific receptor protein Initiation of one or more intracellular signaltransduction pathways A change in cellular metabolism, function or development triggered by the receptor-signal complex Deactivation of receptor Removal of the signal (downregulation) Signaling events are ordered both spatially and temporally Cellular Tools for information transmission Ligands transmit signals Receptors receive information in form of a ligand transmits signal across membrane Transducers pass information enzymatically active may be signal integrators Adapters no catalytic activity modulate proximity of transducers Scaffolds provide architecture allow energetically unfavorable events Effectors perform an end function Ligands (structure) Chamical structure, small molecules: • Small molecules (e.g. amino acid or lipid derivatives, acetylcholine) • Peptides (e.g. ACTH, vasopressin) • Steroids • Retinoids • Thyroxine • Proteins (usually large &amp; hydrophilic, bind to cell-surface receptors) (hydrophobic, bind intracellular receptors) Major classes • Hormones • Growth factors, cytokines, chemokines • Neurotransmitters • Pheromones • Can also be changes in metabolite concentration, e.g. oxygen or nutrients or physical stimuli such as light and heat Models of Cell Signaling ENDOCRINE SIGNALING Example: release of insulin by cells in the pancreas, travels in the blood stream and acts on distal liver, muscle and fat cells PARACRINE SIGNALING Examples: Growth factors and cytokines that signal to neighboring or surrounding cells AUTOCRINE SIGNALING Example: PDGF binds to PDGFproducing and secreting cells to stimulate cell growth SIGNALING BY MEMBRANEATTACHED PROTEINS Example: Delta-Notch signaling Not every ligand that binds to a receptor also activates the receptor Agonists are able to activate the receptor and result in a maximal biological response. The natural endogenous ligand with the greatest efficacy for a given receptor is by definition a full agonist (100% efficacy). Partial agonists do not activate receptors thoroughly, causing responses which are partial compared to those of full agonists. Antagonists bind to receptors but do not activate them. This results in receptor blockage, inhibiting the binding of agonists and inverse agonists. Inverse agonists reduce the activity of receptors by inhibiting their constitutive activity.

Several common cell-surface receptors and signal transduction pathways Overview of signal transduction pathways triggered by receptors that activate protein tyrosine kinases. Structure and dimerization of RTK Dimerization could either happend in cis and trans. Different modes of ligand-mediated dimerization Dimerization of FGF family receptors is aided by heparan sulfate (polysaccharide) Dimerization of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases When not activated, RTKs are monomeric (almost all). Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain causes dimerization (also called cross-linking) of two RTK molecules. This can be accomplished by: The ligand is a monomer and causes a conformational change in the receptor that exposes a binding domain in the RTK that promotes its dimerization (EGF). The ligand is a homo- or heterodimer that thus automatically dimerizes the receptor (PDGF, NGF). The receptor already exists as a dimer (insulin). The ligand is clustered together by binding to extracellular sulfate proteoglycans (FGFs). The RTK undergoes cis or trans autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. This further stimulates the kinase activity of the RTK. Dimerization of EGF family receptors (HER) Different mode of dimerization of EGF family receptors In 25% of breast cancers, HER2 gene is amplified and cancer cells overexpress HER2. What might be the effects of HER2 overexpression? Increase in HER2 expression on the cell surface will make the cell more sensitive to signaling by EGF family ligands. Why? Do the ligands activate same cellular response? Different ligands induce different biological responses via inducing phosphorylations on different Tyr residues Membrane-bound ligand and bidirectional signaling Ephrins are “repulsive” signals that stop neurons from growing into the incorrect areas of the brain. Ephrins are unusual ligands in that many of them are transmembrane proteins. Even though ephrins are monomeric, they are clustered in the plasma membrane of the cell that presents them. This allows for the cross-linking of their receptors, the Eph receptors. Ephrins and Eph receptors carry out bidirectional signaling: when ephrin binds to the Eph receptor, the ephrin undergoes conformational changes that promotes a signal into the cell that presented the ephrin. Monomeric RTK kinase domain is in an inactive state Activation of EGF receptor by EGF results in the formation of an asymmetric kinase domain dimer. Different mode of activation of EGF family receptors Different ways to inhibit RTK Dominant negative Receptor Tyrosine Kinase RTK signaling is downregulated by endocytosis The PDGF Receptor Signaling Complex The PDGF Receptor Signaling Complex The PDGF receptor is phosphorylated on several tyrosines (5 are shown here) Different phosphorylated tyrosine residues activate different signaling pathways Adaptor proteins and RAS Switch The compound eye of Drosophila melanogaster. Sevenless mutants fail to produce R7 receptors Sevenless encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase Genetic studies reveal that activation of Ras induces development of R7 photoreceptors in the Drosophila eye. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Two different classes of proteins associate with phosphotyrosine residues in RTKs. Adapter or Docking proteins: These proteins couple the activated receptor to other signaling molecules but have no intrinsic signaling properties themselves. Enzymes involved in signaling pathways, GEFs and GAPs Adaptor proteins provide additional docking sites for downstream signaling molecules Surface model of an SH2 domain bound to a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide. Activation of Ras following ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or cytokine receptors. RAS is a GTPase that can be turned on and off Ras promotes proliferation and differentiation pathways activated by RTKs. Dominant-negative forms of Ras block these two pathways. Conversely, hyperactive forms of Ras promote proliferation without any extracellular signal. Ras is a major mediator of cancer. ~30% of human cancers have hyperactive forms of Ras. Structures of Ras bound to GDP, Sos protein, and GTP. There are 3 different RAS proteins H-RAS, K-RAS and N-RAS They are all oncogenes MAP kinase pathway RTK (inactive) → bind → RTK dimer → GRB2 SOS → RAS(Inactivate) → RAS(activate) → RAF(MAPKK) → MEK(MAPKK) → MARK (ERK) → Activation of Transcription Active RAS activates the MAP kinase pathway Induction of gene transcription by MAP kinase Outline of the yeast MAP kinase pathways, illustrating similarities and difference in architecture Different scaffold proteins activate different MAP kinases RTK activates other signaling pathways Recruitment and activation of protein kinase B (PKB) in PI-3 kinase pathways Signaling Networks Signal diversity: most receptors activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways. This is one mechanism that allows a single receptor to have multiple effects on a cell. Cross-talk: most signaling pathways contain points where they can be regulated by other signaling pathways. This enables one signaling pathway to “branch out” and affect other target proteins. Redundancy: many pathways are activated by more than one receptor. Thus, different signal molecules can have similar effects on a cell. Signal amplification: multiple steps in an intracellular signaling pathway allows for the signal to be amplified along the way. Thus, very small amounts of a ligand can have dramatic effects.

Receptor Ser/Thr Kinases and SMAD signaling Ser, Thr, Tyr phosphorylation and phosphomimetic aa Part I: Cytokine Receptors and the JAK- STAT pathway Cytokines Cytokines are a family of relatively small, secreted signaling molecules that control cell growth and differentiation, especially the cells in the immune system. interferons (IFNs) and interleukins (IL) Cytokines are critical for generation of all immune cells Erythropoietin and formation of red blood cells Low blood oxygen levels activates HIF1a (hypoxia inducible factor) in the kidney interstitial fibroblasts low blood oxygen levels → activates HIF1a (hypoxia inducible factor) in the kidney interstitial fibroblasts Blood doping in sports: Epo Dr. Francesco Conconi; University of Ferrara Lance Armstrong All cytokines and cytokine receptors have similar structures. Cytokine receptors have two subdomains comprised of seven conserved beta-strands (sheets) which are critical for cytokine- receptor interaction. Epo binds to two identical Epo receptors (homodimer). Cytokine receptors do not have intrinsic kinase activity. Cytokine Receptor Activation Cytokine receptors can form homodimers, heterodimers or oligomers with 3 or more subunits. Cytokine receptors have NO intrinsic enzymatic activity. Rather, the receptors are associated with cytoplasmic kinases called JAK kinase. JAK is tightly bound to the cytosolic domain of all cytokine receptors. In the absence of cytokines, the JAK kinases are not activated. JAK Protein Tyrosine Kinases The JAK (Just Another Kinase, Janus) family are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, which are physically associated with the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors. There are four JAK in mammalian cells: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2 The domain structure of JAKs JH2, pesudo-kinase domain phospholate it’s self to cpntrol the JH1 kinase domain’s activity. JAK kinases have two kinase domains (JH1 and 2) and do not have SH2 or SH3 domains. There are seven well-conserved JAK homology domains (JH). JH1 is the kinase domain, which contains two tyrosines that can be phosphorylated after ligand stimulation. JH2 is considered catalytically inactive. However, a recent study showed that JH2 is a dual-specific kinase which keeps JAK inactive. The JH6 and JH7 domains mediate the binding of JAKs to receptors. There are four mammalian JAKs (JAK1, 2, 3, TYK2) that are associated with specific cytokine receptors. Cytokine Receptor Activation Activated cytokine receptors signal through JAK-family Kinases Binding of ligand triggers receptor dimerization and the activated receptor dimers interact through their intracellular domains which brings the associated-JAKs closer and allows rapid transphosphorylation and activation of the receptor- associated JAKs. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate critical tyrosine residues on the receptor, which leads to recruitment of specific STATs through their SH2 domains followed by single tyrosine phosphorylation of the bound STAT. SH2 domain is phospho-tyrosine-binding domain, which directly binds to phospho-tyrosine residues. The unique amino acid sequence of each SH2 domain determines the specific phospho- tyrosine residues it binds. STAT proteins (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) STAT proteins, a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, are the principal players of JAK-STAT pathway. There are seven mammalian STAT proteins (STAT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, 6) STAT1: INF response STAT2: Development STAT3: EGF and IL-6, Development STAT4: IL-12 STAT5s: prolactin, growth hormones and many ILs STAT6: IL-4 STAT proteins (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) STAT2 STAT4 STAT6 STAT1 STAT3 STAT5a STAT5b Development of T cells IFNg signaling Expressed in different tissues Involved in IFN signaling Development of mammary gland Embryogenesis Control cell cycle and apoptosis (cancer) All STAT proteins share six structural regions: Interaction and dimerization JAKs structure: SH2 domain + DAN binding domain, Linker domain, phosphated Trannsactivation domain The tyrosine residue within the C terminus is phosphorylated when the molecule is activated. Tyr phosphorylation is critical for dimerization and nuclear localization. STAT Activation Recruitment of STAT by p-Tyr of receptors by activated JAK and 3. the formation of activated STAT dimers. Phosphorylated STAT dimers translocate into nucleus and activate transcription of specific genes. Specificity of JAK-STAT signaling STAT heterodimers, homodimers, dimers with coactivators/corepressors Conundrum: There are more than 50 different cytokines but only 4 JAKs and 7 STATs. How is the specificity to different cytokines achieved with only few JAKs and STATs? (e.g. IL6, a proinflammatory cytokine, that utilizes gp130, promotes activation of STAT3, while IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that does not utilize gp130, also activates STAT3.)

Phosphotyrosine phosphatases: PTPs and N-PTPs. SOCS (Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling). PIAS (the protein inhibitor of activated STAT). Negative Regulation by Phosphotyrosine Phosphatases Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the cytoplasm (SH2- domain-containing PTP) , such as SHP1, SHP2, CD45, PTP1B, TC45 inactivate JAKs. Nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatases Nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatases (N-PTPs), such as SHP2, PTP1B, and TC45 dephosphorylate of STATs to complete the cycle of activation/inactivation. The unphosphorylated dimer associates with the nuclear export factor, chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), for transport back to the cytoplasm where it can be reactivated. The STATs are stable throughout this cycle. Domain structure of SOCS proteins (Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling) SOCS proteins contain an SH2 domain that is flanked by a variable amino-terminal domain and a carboxy-terminal SOCS box. The SOCS box can bind to elongins B and C, which are known components of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. The SOCS family of proteins has eight members: cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain protein (CIS) and SOCS1–SOCS7. Negative Regulation by SOCS Proteins SOCS are the target genes of tyrosine phosphorylated STATs; which form a classical negative feedback loop that switches off the activity of JAKs. (1) Binding of SOCS to phosphotyrosine residues on activated receptor or JAK blocks binding of other signaling proteins (such as STATs). (2) The SOCS box can also target proteins such as JAK for degradation by the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. The domain structure of PIAS proteins (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT) PIAS proteins are E3 Sumo-protein ligases and interact with STATs and many other transcription factors. Thus, PIAS proteins act as transcriptional co-regulators. There are four mammalian PIAS genes: PIAS1 PIAS2 PIAS3 PIAS4 Negative Regulation by PIAS Proteins a. PIAS1 and PIAS3 block the DNA- binding activity of STAT dimers. b. PIASX (PIAS2) and PIASY (PIAS4) might act as transcriptional co- repressors of STAT by recruiting other co-repressor proteins such as histone deacetylase (HDAC). c. PIAS proteins can promote the conjugation of small ubiquitin- related modifier (SUMO) to STAT1. JAK-STAT signaling JAK-STAT signaling regulates many cellular processes including: innate and adaptive immune function. Development. cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The JAK-dependent or –independent STAT tyrosine phosphorylation Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs can also be stimulated by binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as epidermal growth factor receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor. This activation may be direct or indirect. The latter case involves the recruitment of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) such as Src-family tyrosine kinases. Alternatively, the STATs can be tyrosine phosphorylated in a JAK-dependent manner after hormone- and chemokine- binding to G protein-coupled receptors (also known as seven-transmembrane receptors). Unphosphorylated STAT proteins Recent evidence shows that unphosphorylated STATs can enter the nucleus via importin-α-dependent (STAT2, STAT3) or carrier-independent transport (STAT 1, 3, 5). In unstimulated cells, unphosphorylated STATs (STAT 1, 2, 3, 5) constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 have been found to activate transcription by binding to other transcription factors (IRF1 and NF-κB, respectively). Part II: PI-3 kinase pathway Generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates important in cancers PI-3 kinase (Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) PLCg activates PKC via IP3 and DAG PI-3 kinase Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphoinositide (4,5) bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)2) to generate the lipid second- messenger phosphoinositide (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)3), which binds to PH (pleckstrin homology) domains of effector proteins, inducing their plasma membrane translocation and activation. PI3K is comprised of two subunits: Regulatory subunit Catalytic subunit Classification and domain structure of mammalian PI3Ks p85 Regulatory p85 Regulatory subunit binds to p-Tyr of RTKs, Cytokine receptors or adaptor proteins and activates the p110 catalytic subunit PI-3 kinase Receptor Tyrosine kinase Cytokine receptor Adaptor Proteins Recruitment and activation of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) in PI-3 kinase pathways Activation of PI3K triggers diverse cellular responses The PI-3 Kinase Pathway Is Negatively Regulated by PTEN Phosphatase Signaling via the PI-3 kinase pathway is terminated by the PTEN phosphatase. The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) gene encodes a plasma membrane lipid phosphatase that is recurrently lost in various human cancers. PTEN phosphatase: the major function: its ability to remove the 3-phosphate from PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate. also it can remove phosphate groups attached to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in proteins. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5- trisphosphate generation PTEN Phosphatase The PTEN gene is deleted in multiple types of advanced human cancers. The resulting loss of PTEN protein contributes to the uncontrolled growth of cells. Part III: TGF-β receptors and the SMAD signaling pathway TGF-β Superfamily the multipotential cytokine TGF-β was first identified for its ability to induce a malignant phenotype(anchorage-independent growth) in several cultured early stage cancerous mammalian cell lines. Cancerous cells: Loss of contact inhibition of cell growth (cultured in vitro). Colony formation in soft agar(anchorage-independent growth). Tumor formation in vivo. In general, TGF- b signaling inhibits cell proliferation. From Roberts et al., Cancer Research 1981; 41:2842-48 TGF β Superfamily Transforming Growth Factor b (TGF b ) family comprises a large number of secreted and structurally related proteins with multiple roles in all major cell activities including developmental patterning, tissue differentiation and proliferation, and homeostasis. The TGF b family is divided into distinct classes, based on different biological functions: TGF- b (three human isoforms TGF- b 1, 2, and 3), known to potently prevent the proliferation of most normal (non-cancerous) mammalian cells; also to promote expression of cell-adhesion molecules and extracellular-matrix molecules, which play important roles in tissue organization. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), known to induce the formation of bone and cartilage. Many BMPs are critical for development of many tissues. Activins and inhibins are important for genital development. Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS). Structure of TGF β Superfamily TGF-β is produced by many different cells in the body and inhibits growth both of the secreting cell (autocrine signaling) and neighboring cells (paracrine signaling). TGF β Receptor Activation Signaling by all TGF β family members occurs via transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that upon ligand binding form a heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. In the canonical pathway, signaling to the transcriptional machinery is transduced by a unique family of intracellular signaling mediators called SMADs. TGF β Receptors I and II are Ser/Thr Kinases TGF-β binds either RII (intrinsic kinase activity) or RIII. Ligand bound receptor RII recruits and phosphorylates RI on Ser/Thr residues. The activated RI phosphorylates SMAD2 or 3. Phosphorylation of SMAD2 or 3 leads to NLS unmasking. Two phosphorylated SMAD2 or 3 proteins bind to SMAD4 with importin- b to form a large cytosolic complex. and After the entire complex translocates into nucleus, the importin dissociates by Ran-GTP protein. TFE3 (a nuclear transcription factor) then associates with Smad2/3/4 complex to form an activation complex which binds to the regulatory sequence of a target gene. This complex then recruits transcriptional co-activators and induces gene transcription. The dephosphorylation of Smad2/3 by a nuclear phosphatase. Smad2/3 recycles through a nuclear pore to the cytosol for the reactivation by another TGF b receptor complex. SMADs SMADs are intracellular proteins that transduce extracellular signals from TGF b ligands to the nucleus where they activate downstream gene transcription. There are three classes of SMAD: The receptor-regulated Smads (R-SMAD): SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD5 and SMAD8/9. The common-mediator Smad (co-SMAD): only SMAD4 which interacts with R-SMADs to participate in signaling. The antagonistic or inhibitory Smads (I-SMAD): SMAD6 and SMAD7 which block the activation of R-SMADs and Co-SMADs. The SMADs, which form a trimer of two receptor-regulated SMADs and one co-SMAD, act as transcription factors that regulate the gene expression. The domain structure of SMADs and their interactions The C-terminal SSXS motif of receptor-regulated Smads is directly phosphorylated by specific type I receptors. This phosphorylation allows both the association of the receptor-regulated Smads with Smad4 and translocation into the nucleus. N-terminal MH1 domain contains the specific DNA- binding segment and the nuclear-localization signal (NLS).Three serine residues near the C-terminus of R- Smad are directly phosphorylated by activated type I receptors. This phosphorylation induces NLS unmasking and allows both the association of the receptor- regulated Smads with Smad4 through the phosphoserine-binding sites in the MH2 domain and translocation into the nucleus. Negative feedback regulation of TGF- b /Smad signaling pathway Ski and SnoN, inhibiting transcription mediated by the Smad2/3/Smad4 complex. (Ski and SnoN are oncogenes). I-Smad 7, inhibiting Smad activation. TGIF (Transforming growth interacting factor), a potential repressor of TGF b signaling. Model of Ski-mediated down-regulation of Smad transcription-activating function Ski directly binds to Smad4 and P-R-Smads. Binding of Ski disrupts the normal interactions between Smad3 and Smad4 necessary for transcriptional activation. Ski recruits N-CoR, which directly binds to mSin3A; in turn, mSin3A interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC). HDAC-induced chromatin remodeling and transcription repression. TGF b causes rapid degradation of Ski and SnoN but after few hours, SnoN expression is induced by Smad2/Smad4 complex, which then inhibits the Smad complex. Negative feedback regulation of TGF- b /Smad signaling pathway Inhibitory Smad, Smad7, is a transcriptional target of Smad signaling, which acts in a negative feedback loop to inhibit Smad activation. Smad7 binds to the receptor and blocks the ability of activated type I receptors (RI) to phosphorylate R-Smad; and it also recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf 1/2 (Smad Ubiquitin Regulatory Factors 1/2), to mediate receptor degradation. I-Smads and Smurfs regulate receptor turnover Loss of TGF b signaling plays a key role in cancer development TGF- b signaling generally inhibits cell proliferation. Loss of various components of the signaling pathway contributes to abnormal cell proliferation and malignancy, for example, Inactivating mutations of either TGF b receptors or R-Smad or Smad4 proteins are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF b . Smad4, called DPC (deleted in pancreatic cancer). Mutations in Smad2 in several types of human tumors. loss of type I or type II TGF- b receptors in retinoblastoma, colon and gastric cancer, hepatoma, and some T- and B-cell malignancies.

It may be a hormone, a growth factor/cytokine, a steroid, a polypeptide, or other type of molecules. The ligand has no activity of its own, it must bind to a macromolecule which is known as a receptor. • Receptor: protein molecules that bind to ligand with high specificity. When activated by the ligand, the receptor induces changes in the target cells/tissues in which it is expressed. • Hormone response element (HRE): the specific motif on the DNA to which the receptor binds. • Dimerization: one protein molecule forms a complex with another, usually via non covalent bonds. The protein molecules can be the same (homodimer) or different (heterodimer). The mode of signaling is determined by the chemical nature of the ligand • Lipophilic or hydrophobic ligands such as steroids can pass through the cell membrane and thus use intracellular receptors. • Hydrophilic ligands such as peptides and growth factors cannot pass through the cell membrane and thus use cell surface receptors. Hormone signaling Nuclear Receptor: Classical Definition Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a family of structurally similar, ligand-activated transcription factors that reside within the cells. Upon binding to ligands, NRs exert their functions in the nucleus and regulate the expression of genes with a wide range of physiological functions, such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cell death, etc. Type I Nuclear Receptor (Steroid Hormone Receptors) Including ER, PR, AR, GR, and MR Ligand-dependent transcription factors Unliganded receptors reside in the cytoplasm, form a complex with chaperones (heat shock proteins and immunophilins) After binding to ligands, translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA as homodimers.

Play an important role in nuclear translocation of SRs Chaperones maintain the conformation of NRs for ligand-binding Transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane NLS: nuclear localization signal; NES: nuclear export signal LMB: leptomycin B, inhibitor of nuclear export Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of Type I Nuclear Receptors Type I NRs cannot diffuse through the nuclear pore complex due to their sizes (&gt; 40 KDa) Nuclear translocation is a tightly regulated process. Depending on the receptor and physiological settings, the nuclear translocation of Type I NRs can be ligand-dependent or –independent. The active transport of NRs always dependents on the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLSs).

The Gbg subunit in both stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins is identical; the Ga subunits and the receptors differ. • Gsa stimulates adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP • Virtually all the diverse effects of cAMP are mediated through PKA • The resulting cellular response depends on the particular PKA isoform and the PKA substrates expressed by the cell PKA Links GPCRs to transcription CREB = CRE-binding protein, found in the nucleus, phosphorylated and activated by PKA CRE = cAMP responsive element Table 15-2 mAKAP anchors both PKA and PDE to the nuclear membrane, maintaining them in a negative feedback loop Basal PDE activity: Resting state Increased cAMP: PKA activation PDE phosphorylation and activation; reduction in cAMP level mAKAP - A kinase-associated protein kinase; anchoring PDE - cAMP phosphodiesterase PKA - protein kinase A Synthesis of 2nd messengers DAG and IP3 IP3/DAG pathway and the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ Provides close local control of the cAMP level 30 cytosol membrane Actin remodeling Endocytosis Vesicle fusion 2nd messengers table 15-3 Feedback regulation and desensitization of the signaling pathway Inactivate receptor + G Protein + Inactive effector Mechanisms to attenuate signaling by GPCRs • Removal of stimulus - reuptake, degradation • Affinity of receptor for ligand decreases when GDP bound G- protein becomes replaced with GTP • GTP is quickly hydrolyzed, inactivating Ga (e.g. reversing the activation of adenylyl cyclase &amp; production of cAMP) • Removal of 2nd messenger (e.g. cAMP phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cAMP to 5’-AMP, terminating the cellular response) • Receptor desensitization • Receptor endocytosis - recycling or degradation GPCR desensitization • Feedback suppression • Heterologous desensitization • Homologous desensitization Feedback suppression The end product of a pathway blocks an early step in the pathway Example: activation of receptor Leads to activation of PKA, PKA phosphorylates the same receptor, reducing its ability to activate adenylyl cyclase Homologous Desensitization • Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of receptors mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) • Receptor interaction with intracellular proteins called arrestins • Arrestin binding sterically precludes coupling between the receptor and heterotrimeric G proteins • Termination of signaling by effector G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) N Catalytic Domain 0 50 100 amino acids amino-terminal domain (receptor-binding?) autophosphorylation region Variable region (membrane targeting) C • Rhodopsin kinase or visual (GRK1 and GRK7) • β-adrenergic receptor kinases (GRK2/GRK3) • GRK4 (GRK4, GRK5 and GRK6) Heterologous Desensitization Activation of one type of receptor can activate signal transduction leading to the desensitization of a different receptor (agonist-independent phosphorylation) Luttrell L M , and Lefkowitz R J J Cell Sci 2002;115:455-465 ©2002 by The Company of Biologists Ltd β-arrestins can act as adapters Receptor-bound b-arrestins also act as adapter proteins, binding to components of the clathrin endocytic machinery and other signaling molecules. β-arrestin-induced signaling RhoA-dependent stress fiber formation inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)- targeted gene expression through IκB stabilization Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)- mediated dephosphorylation of Akt, which leads to the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent induction of protein translation and antiapoptosis Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)- mediated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) induction and increased vasodilation through GPR109A activation Kif3A-dependent relocalization and activation of the protein Smoothened (Smo) in the primary cilium (21). 44 Phosphorylated (desensitized) receptors are constantly being resensitized owing to dephosphorylation by constitutive phosphatases.

A) binding of ligand to receptor B) synthesis of a secondary messenger C) activation of a protein kinase D) receptor desensitization E) receptor activation of a G protein In B, C, and E, each signaling molecule produces/activates more than one of the next signaling molecule. GPCR Signaling Diversity Oligomerization of GPCRs can confer unique pharmacological and functional profiles to a receptor, including affinity for specific peptide ligands and coupling to novel G proteins. Both homo- and hetero-oligomeric receptor complexes may have the ability to couple to more than one G protein, depending on their cellular environment, thereby conferring the ability to mediate different intracellular responses to the same ligand. Disruption of G protein signaling can cause disease Cholera • Cholera toxin catalyzes covalent modification of Gsa. ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD+ to an arginine residue at the GTPase active site of Gsa. • ADP-ribosylation prevents Gsa from hydrolyzing GTP. Thus G sa becomes permanently activated. • Resulting excessive rise in intracellular cAMP leads to loss of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, producing watery diarrhea. Whooping Cough Disease Colonization of tracheal epithelial cells by Bordetella pertussis Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation at a cysteine residue of Gia, making the inhibitory Ga incapable of exchanging GDP for GTP. Thus the inhibitory pathway is blocked Resulting increase in cAMP in epithelial cells of the airways promotes loss of fluids and electrolytes and mucus secretion. These toxins can be useful tools in the lab used to determine whether a particular agonist of a GPCR invokes activation of members of the Gia or Gsa family If the GPCR mediates its effects through Giawe should see an increase in activity (cAMP) when we apply the pertusis toxin compared to control. If the GPCR mediates its effects through Gsa we should see a significant increase in activity (cAMP) when we apply the cholera toxin.

Targets for MPF? • nuclear lamins A&amp;C (alternative splice products of a single gene) lamin B stays associated with nuclear membrane through isoprenylation. • SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins, which form condensin, a multi-protein complex. Addition of an anti- SMC antibody to xenopus extracts prevents DNA condensation and association of sister chromatids. • SMC must be phosphorylated to wind DNA into supercoils. SMC is also a component of cohesin, which holds sister chromatids together at the centromere. Another component of cohesin is Scc1, a target for separase.

Classification: Aggression behaviors Benign tumor Malignant tumor (a.k.a. Cancer) Location of the tumor Carcinoma (epithelial origin) Sarcoma (mesenchymal origin/connective tissues) Others (lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, and etc.) Oncogenic Virus (tumor virus): A virus capable of causing transformation of cells, inducing a neoplasia in its host or causally linked to human tumors. General criteria for oncogenic viruses The virus or part of its genome should be closely associated with the oncogenic disease (e.g., should be present in tumor tissues). The virus should persist throughout the disease. A prospective study should show that infection with the virus precedes disease. Prevention of virus infection (e.g., by vaccine) should prevent disease. Why has the study of oncogenic viruses been important? It’s estimated that ~20% of human cancers in the world are caused by infection, of which 10-15% are caused by oncogenic viruses. In the past, research on oncogenic viruses led to the discovery of key cellular tumor suppressor proteins (e.g. p53) and general pathways involved in tumor development. Studies of SV40 led to the discovery of tumor suppressor p53 DIscovery of p53 AgT → 53kDa protein interacted with AgT, which functoin as tumor suppressor.

Genes (i.e. tumor suppressor genes) that inhibit cell growth are turned off. Generally, oncogenic viruses either carry a copy of oncogenes or can alter expression of the cell’s copy of these genes. Why do oncogenic viruses want to disrupt growth control? It’s viruses’ way to fight against the host defense system and to meet their needs for replication and continuation of their species. Oncogenic viruses might accidentally cause tumors, since killing your host is a poor way to ensure your survival even if he/she is trying to kill you.

SV40 can induce tumors including primary brain cancers, malignant mesotheliomas, bone tumors, and systemic lymphomas in test animals. Simian virus 40 in human malignant disease In 2002, the National Academy of Sciences Immunization Safety Review committee that stated, &quot;The committee concludes that the biological evidence is moderate that SV40 exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions.” In 2004, the National Cancer Institute announced that “substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV40 likely does not cause cancer in humans”. In 2006, new evidence indicated that SV40 is involved in the development of peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma in human. Simian virus 40 (SV40) Belongs to polyomavirus family.

Adenovirus mediated oncogenesis Oncogenes: E1A E1B Oncogenesis mediated by small DNA tumor virus In benign lesions induced by the small DNA tumor viruses, viral genomes are typically maintained extrachromosomally. Malignant progression is often associated with viral integration into host cell chromatin. Integration usually leads to abnormal expression of early genes. Early genes promote cell cycle progression and prevent apoptosis. HPV - E7 (cell cycle) and E6 (apoptosis) SV40 - T Ag (cell cycle and apoptosis) Adenovirus - E1A (cell cycle) and E1B (apoptosis) Human oncogenic viruses DNA tumor viruses: Complex DNA tumor viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBV belongs to human herpes virus family (a.k.a. HHV-4). Infect &gt;90% of the adult population in U.S (EveryBody’s Virus). Infect lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Transmitted by saliva. Generally, don’t need to integrate. Cause lymphoma in Marmosets and transform human B-lymphocytes in vitro. EBV in human diseases Malignant diseases: Burkitt’s lymphoma in the tropics, where it is more common in malaria-endemic regions. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in China and southeast Asia, where certain diets may act as co-carcinogens. B cell lymphomas in immune suppressed individuals (such as in organ transplantation or HIV). Hodgkin’s lymphoma in which it has been detected in a high percentage of cases (about 40% of affected patients). Non-Malignant diseases: Infectious mononucleosis (a.k.a. kissing disease, glandular fever) Autoimmune diseases including dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Enveloped, linear dsDNA genome in virions; circular dsDNA in host cells. ~171kb genome. Latency genes and lytic genes. EBV life cycle There are 2 stages in EBV’s life cycle: latency and lytic replication (reactivation). Latency: viral persistence. Lytic replication: production of new infectious virions. EBV Encodes its own polymerases and don’t need S-phase environment for replication. EBV latency programs EBV latent genes EBNA2 and LMP1 are absolutely required for EBV-mediated transformation of B cells. EBNA-LP, EBNA3A and EBNA3C play a critical role in the transformation process. EBV Nuclear Antigen 2 (EBNA2) First virus protein expressed after infection of B cells. Plays a pivotal role in B cell immortalization. Transcription factor, regulate the expression of viral LMP1 and LMP2 as well as cellular oncogene c-Myc. Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) Classical oncogene (transgenic mice expressing LMP1 alone in B cells develop lymphomas). Acts as constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) CD40. Inhibits apoptosis by upregulating BCL2 and A20. Activates NF-kB pathway and JAK/STAT pathway. EBV Nuclear Antigen 3C (EBNA3C) Essential for B-cell transformation in vitro. Cell cycle regulator. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) Discovered in 1994, belongs to the herpes virus family (a.k.a. HHV-8). ~10% of the general population has been infected in U.S. Transmitted through sexual contact and organ transplantation. Causes Kaposi’s sarcoma, body cavity-based lymphoma, and Castleman’s disease. Enveloped dsDNA genome. Latency and lytic replication. Molecular piracy (molecular mimicry). Major latent genes: LNA-1, v-cyclin, and v- FLIP. Regulation of cell cycle by KSHV LNA-1 and v-Cyclin LNA1 → RB; p53; Ring3 Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Belongs to Hepadnavirus family. Circular Partially dsDNA genome. Causes hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV mediated oncogenesis Mechanism is not clear. Integration disrupts oncogene or tumor- suppressor genes. Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein.

So, there are more specific assays like, apoptosis assay, proliferation assay, and function assay. MTT Assay. Hemocytometer © Abishek Vembadi, et al Cell Counter © acmerevival Viability assay: MTT Assay Principle Water soluble yellow MTT Reduced to purple insoluble formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenases Water insoluble formazan can be solubilized using isopropanol or other solvents The dissolved material is measered spectrophotometrically yielding absorbance as a function of concentration of converted dye. Mitochondrial Dehydrogenase catalize the Yellow MTT to purple insoluble form © wikipedia Video Protocol: Abnova: MTT Assay; 2010 Why MTT assay: Though dyes like Trypan blue could mark living cell based on the intact cell membrane, but can’t tell which cell are dying. MTT Tetrazolium Reduction Assay, which is a colorimetric assay. Cellular oxidoreductase enzymes reduce the terazolium dye MTT bromide to its insoluble form ozone which has a purple color, quantity was based on the changes in absorbance at 570nm using a spectrophotometer. As a result, it can be used to measure cytotoxicity loss of viable cells or cytostastic activity shift from proliferation to quiesence of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. Advantage: Fewer steps, uses fewer materials, and does not carry the added burden of radioactive waste disposal. Disadvantages: Not suitable for suspending cells, Must be optimized for seeding amount and assay duration to obtain satisfactory results Precipitated protein and cellular debris present in the cell culture plate wells may interfere with the optical ratings Creative Bioarray[1] MTS: adding into culture media directly. (expensive) MTT, MTS, CCK-8, SRB Significance: Tetrazolium dye reduction is assumed to be dependnet on NAD§H-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme. The sensitivity of the cell group are different from each other.

This antibiotic is a potent inhibitor of cellular DNA synthesis by targeting α, ε, and δ DNA polymerases in eukaryotic cells lines with little to no effect on β or γ DNA polymerases. Studies have shown that Aphidicolin specifically binds to α DNA polymerase, resulting in the formation of a pol α-DNA-aphidicolin ternary complex that blocks DNA replication. The uses for this compound include synchronized cells at the G1/S boundary and increased gene amplification.[4] Hydronxyurea The therapeutic effect is generally believed to be due to the suppression of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which slows DNA polymerase movement at replication forks and induces an S phase cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells.[5] Mitotic shake-off Adherent cells round up in mitosis © Lucy H. Swift, Roy M. GolsteynEmail Many cells round up during mitosis and are less firmly attached to the culture substratum, so that gentle shaking of the culture vessel will detach the mitotic cells. Centrifugal Elutriation © Fredrik B Thorén Synchronization of cells and nuclei is a powerful technique for the exact study of regulatory mechanisms and for understanding cell cycle events. Counterflow centrifugal elutriation is a biophysical cell separation technique in which cell size and sedimentation density differences of living cells are exploited to isolate subpopulations in various stages of cell cycle. This cell separation technique is available since 1948. Centrifugal elutriation offers the advantage that it does not perturb the cell cycle progression; it selects uniformly sized cells, as the cell size generally correlates with cell cycle stage. The major advantage of centrifugal elutriation is that it permits the selection of cells during the whole cell cycle. Among the disadvantages of elutriation, the moderate dispersion of synchrony could be mentioned in fractions collected at the end of the elutriation process, especially in the late S, G2 and M phases. Best synchrony with elutriation is achieved in G1 and in early and mid S phase. Nevertheless, this method is still regarded as one of the best ways of preparing ‘unperturbed’ synchronous yeast cultures for cell cycle studies. Analysis of the DNA distributions after centri- fugal elutriation confirmed that excellent synchrony was obtained with low dispersion throughout the cell cycle. Source: Gaspar Banfalvi What is the evidence for cell cycle control Fuse a mitotic cell with any other cell drives it into mitosis. Fuse a S phase cell with one in G1 – both are in S- incorporate labeled nucleotides. Fuse a G2 cell with one in S – S continues to replicate, but no DNA synthesis in G2 cell. Diffusable factors are the cell cycle engine, which is conserved from yeast to man. Fusing cell??? Oocyte Maturation The oocyte is 4C. What is the DNA content after each step? Step 1 requires protein synthesis How can you use the frog oocyte to assay for MPF??? MPF from yeast to man works in the oocyte injection assay MPF activity in frog development The embryonic cell cycle of xenopus laevis Cleavage without growth- 12 consecutive mitoses – no RNA synthesis Oocyte stockpiles materials for multicellular embryo The frog embryonic cycle is regulated by a biochemical oscillator • Fertilize frog eggs and they divide. • Block spindle assembly with nocodazole – fertilized egg still oscillates. • Block DNA synthesis with aphidicolin – still oscillates. • Inhibit protein synthesis with cycloheximide – embryos will not divide after fertilization. • Oscillation occurs in the absence of a nucleus. • Inhibit protein synthesis and inject MPF – embryos enter mitosis. Downstream events (chromosome decondensation and DNA synthesis) regulated by the destruction of MPF in embryonic cells. Fertilization leads to rapid inactivation of MPF. Identifying the oscillator Why does the cell cycle engine oscillate? Protein degraded at onset of anaphase. Tim Hunt showed that a subunit of MPF had this protein – cyclin B Xenopus egg extract Electrically activate xenopus eggs- prepare extract and add sperm nuclei. Replication occurs, chromosomes condense and nuclei form in cyclic fashion. Inhibit protein synthesis and extract stops cycling. Add antisense RNA to cyclin B – stop cycling. Non-degradable cyclin B mRNA lacks 90 a.a. from N-terminus. Cyclin accumulates before MPF is detected. Accumulate cyclin B to high levels and destroy.

The budding yeast S. cerevisiae: Antibody to cdc2 immunoprecipitates MPF. MPF is a heterodimer of cdc2/cdc13 with protein kinase activity. Cdc13 has homology to cyclin B.

Receptors A membrane-spanning receptor transduces chemical signal across membranes Some broad classes: Channel receptors (Acetylcholine receptor) Tyrosine Kinase (Insulin, growth factor) G-protein coupled (adrenergic, rhodopsin) G-protein coupled receptors all belong to a widespread class called 7TM receptors because they have 7 membrane-spanning helices. The C2 Domain sterols provide structural support to membranes, preventing too close a packing of the phospholipids’ acyl chains to maintain a significant measure of membrane fluidity, and at the same time conferring the necessary rigidity required for mechanical support. 2. Cholesterol restricts the random movement of phospholipid head groups at the outer surfaces of the leaflets, but its effect on the movement of long phospholipid tails depends on its concentration. At the cholesterol concentrations normally present in the plasma membrane, the interaction of the steroid ring with the long hydrophobic tails of phospholipids tends to immobilize those lipids and thus decreases biomembrane fluidity. It is this property that can help organize the plasma membrane into discrete subdomains of unique lipid and protein composition. At lower cholesterol concentrations, however, the steroid ring separates and disperses phospholipid tails, causing the inner regions of the membrane to become slightly more fluid.

(mostly: uronic acid and amino sugar) Glycosaminoglycans are classifide primarily according to the amino sugar they contain. Because of their highly charge, GAGs are osmotically active and imbibe large quantities of water. GAGs form the porous hydrated gels that fill most of the extracellular space. Collagen and elastic fibers comprise the reinforcing fiber embedded in this “ground substance”. uronic acid and sulfide compounts contributed the negative charge of the Glycosaminoglycans Proteoglycans © Hussein Kaoud Most GAGs (with the exception of the hyaluronic acid) are covalently linked to a protein core. These covalent conjugages are called proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are normally given names when the protein core to which the GAG is attached has been cloned and sequenced. Formerly, the core proteins of the proteoglycans were thought to have a passive role of carry glycosaminoglycan GAG chains. It appears now, however, that, the core protein so of the some molecules are involved in mediating outside-in signals generated by the binding of ligands.

This antibody has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis, most of which can be attributed to inflammation. A low molecular weight agonist (activator) of the αMβ2 integrin also prevents extravasation of the leukocytes and decreases inflammation. This drug is not yet in clinical trials. Modulating integrin action decreases inflammation Integrins Integrins are obligate heterodimers containing two distinct chains, called the α and β subunits. In mammals, 19 α and 8 β subunits have been characterized. There are many types of integrins, and many cells have multiple types on their surface. Integrin Structure. Both the alpha and beta subunits are attached to the cellular plasma membrane through a single transmembrane helix. The binding specificity of integrins depends upon the nature of the alpha and beta subunit. Most integrins recognized relatively short peptide motifs and in general require an acidic amino acid to be present. Integrin Function Many integrins are expressed on the surface of cells in an inactive state, where they do not bind ligands and do not signal. Integrins interact with the elements of the extracellular matrix and mediate various intracellular signals. They define cellular shape, mobility, and regulate the cell cycle. Integrin Signaling Integrins communicate biochemical and mechanical signals in a bidirectional manner across the plasma membrane. Intracellular signals switch integrins into a ligand-competent state as a result of conformational changes in the extracellular domain. Binding of extracellular ligands induces, in turn, structural changes that convey distinct signals to the cell interior. cell signaling Structural adaptors (e.g. talin, tensin,) link integrins directly to the cytoskeleton Scaffolding adaptors (e.g. paxillin, kindlin) forms bridges between focal adhesion proteins. Catalytic adaptors (e.g. focal adhesion kinase, integrin-linked kinase, Src) propagate signal transduction from adhesion sites. Phosphorylation state of cytoplasmic tail residues modulate the competition between adaptors for binding and hence the subsequent cytoskeletal interactions of integrins and response. Interactions between beta integrins and signaling proteins FAK, focal adhesion kinase p130Cas, an adaptor that promotes protein–protein interactions, leading to the formation of multiprotein complexes Crk, a family of signal transducing adaptor proteins that contain SRC homology domains and play a role in cytoskeletal reorganization. Abl, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion, and stress response. Be able to name the proteins that integrins use for signal transduction. Integrins activate intracellular signaling pathways Which signaling pathway is initiated by integrin activation is based on the biological context, as well as the ligands bound (matrix components, growth factors). Depending on the combination of these factors, a variety of short-term and long-term responses may result. Substrate stiffness has also been shown to affect the type of adhesion structure formed following integrin activation. Integrin signals intersect growth- factor pathways at multiple points. PAK proteins are critical effectors that link Rho GTPases to cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling. They consist of a family of serine/threonine p21- activating kinases, serve as targets for the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and RAC and have been implicated in a wide range of biological activities.

Two main types of protein: Soluble protein and Integral protein. Synthesis of: secreted proteins integral plasma-membrane proteins proteins destined for the ER, Golgi complex, plasma membrane, or lysosome begins on cytosolic ribosomes. A signal sequence, SRP, and SRP receptor system docks the ribosome on an ER translocation and cotranslationally inserts the nascent protein into or through the ER membrane.

Synthesis and processing for plasma membrane and secreted proteins, and proteins functioning in the ER, Golgi complex and lysosomes. Protein synthesis on the ER: ER membrane-bound and free cytosolic ribosomes are identical. Membrane-bound ribosomes: recruited to the ER during synthesis of a polypeptide containing an ER signal sequence. Secretory Proteins Enter the ER Lumen © Daniel A. Nissley, et al. 2016 Pulse-chase experiments: secretory proteins are in ER lumen right after synthesis. before the synthesis of first 70 AAs. Pulse radiolabeled amino acids only newly synthesized proteins labeled. Cells homogenized: shears rough ER into small vesicles called microsomes. Purified microsomes treated with a protease: (–) Detergent: proteins in ER are protected from digestion. (+) Detergent: dissolves ER membrane; proteins not protected from digestion. Detergent: disrupt the membrane system to expose the secrete protein Conclusion: newly made proteins are inside the microsomes (lumen of the rough ER) after synthesis.

SRP recognition: Signal recognition particle (SRP) binds SS – arrests protein synthesis. SS, SPR, Ribosome; SRPr complex: SPR-ribosome complex binds SRP receptor in ER membrane; interaction strengthened by the binding of GTP to both the SRP and its receptor. SRP dissociates: Transfer of nascent polypeptide–ribosome to translocon; opens translocation channel. SRP and SRP receptor both hydrolyze bound GTP; dissociates SRP from ribosome and receptor; restarts protein synthesis. SS cleaved: Peptide passes thru translocon into ER lumen; signal sequence cleaved. extrudes: Growing peptide chain extrudes thru translocon into ER.

Oligosaccharide precursor + dolichol phosphate. Sugar residues added sequentially as activated sugar-NDPs. Steps 1-3: Two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and five mannose residues added on ER membrane cytosolic face. Step 4: intermediate is flipped to ER membrane luminal face. Steps 5-6: Additional sugar-NDPs flipped to the luminal face and transferred to the growing oligosaccharide precursor. Tunicamycin blocks step 1, inhibits all N-linked glycosylation. PS: Precursor contain 14 residues and very conservative among eukaryotic.

Targeting Sequences: N-terminal targeting sequences direct post-translational transport of the unfolded proteins through translocons into the organelles. Direction: Multiple internal targeting sequences direct protein targeting inside the organelles to different membrane and lumen destinations. PS: Energy required, usually two system: one for targeting the organelles, one for sorting to the part of the organelle.

Looked at time points to determine cell location. At 0 time point, VSV G-GFP retained in ER. At 40 min, most concentrated in the Golgi. At 180 min, most VSV G-GFP has integrated into and is diffusing within the plasma membrane. Secretory and Endocytic Pathways © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p633 Transport vesicles transport membrane and soluble proteins from one membrane-bound compartment to another. Transport vesicles collect cargo proteins in membrane budding from a donor compartment and deliver cargo by fusing with a target membrane. Secretory pathway distributes cargo proteins to final destinations (ER, Golgi, cell surface (including secretion) or lysosomes. Cargo buds from the ER, fuse together to form a new cis-Golgi cisternae → move by nonvesicular cisteral maturation, and retrograde vesicle transport. Regulated (aggregates) and constitutive secretion. Lysosomal proteins bud and fuse with late endosome. Endocytic vesicles bud from plasma membrane, delivered to lysosomes via late endosomes.

Small GTPase proteins direct coat protein polymerization on donor membranes to pinch off vesicles carrying different cargoes. Coat shedding exposes Rab and SNARE proteins that target vesicles for fusion with specific target membranes. Vesicle Budding and Fusion with a Target Membrane © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p640 Coat proteins bind membrane cargo cytosolic domain. Soluble cargo bind receptors, receptor also binds coat protein. Vesicle SNARES (v-SNARES) captured in budding vesicle. Coat evaginates donor membrane, pinches off coated vesicle. Monomeric GTP-binding protein also binds coat protein in GTPbound form. GTP hydrolysis → decoating. G protein also leaves. Decoating uncovers v-SNARES, interaction with target membrane t-SNARES for membrane fusion. Coated Vesicles Involved in Protein Trafficking Three major types of transport vesicles: each with a different type of protein coat and monomeric GTPase protein. Vesicle Type Transport Step Mediated Coat Proteins Associated GTPase COPII ER to cis-Golgi Sec23/Sec24 and Sec13/Sec31, Sec16 Sar1 COPI cis-Golgi to ER Later to earlier Golgi cisternae Coatomers containing seven different COP subunits ARF Clathrin and adapter proteins* trans-Golgi to endosome Clathrin + AP1 complexes ARF trans-Golgi to endosome Clathrin + GGA ARF Plasma membrane to endosome Clathrin + AP2 complexes ARF Golgi to lysosome, melanosome, or platelet vesicles AP3 complexes ARF Sar1 Role Assembly/Disassembly of COPII Coat © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p641 GEF function: Sar1-GDP → Sar1-GTP, membrane bound. Sar1-GTP recruits coat proteins, curvature forms bud w/ cargo. GTP hydrolysis, Sar1-GDP loses affinity for vesicle membrane. Sar1-GDP not membrane bound, promotes coat disassembly. Image: Coated vesicles accumulate during in vitro budding in presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Docking/Fusion of Vesicle w/Target Membrane © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p643 Vesicle Rab binds Rab effector on target membrane. v-SNARE forms stable coiled-coil interaction with t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25); hold vesicle close to target membrane. Fusion of two membrane → drives dissociation of the SNARE complexes (4), freeing SNARE proteins (recycled by NSF – an AAA-family member).

COPI-coated vesicles transport vesicles carrying ER/Golgi-resident proteins in the retrograde direction, which supports Golgi cisternal maturation. Vesicle-Mediated ER and cis-Golgi Trafficking © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p644 Forward (anterograde) transport: COPII vesicles ER → cis-Golgi transport. Step 1: COPII coat assembles. Step 2: COPII coat disassembly. Step 3: Membrane fusion Reverse (retrograde) transport: COPI vesicle cis-Golgi to ER transport. Cargo: recycles membrane bilayer, v-SNAREs, and missorted ERresident proteins. Step 4: COPI coat assembles. Step 5: COPI coat disassembly. Step 6: Membrane fusion. KDEL Receptor Retrieval of ER-Resident Luminal Proteins from the Golgi © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p647 Soluble ER proteins contain KDEL (LysAsp-Glu-Leu) ER-targeting sequence. May become missorted to cis-Golgi: Nonspecifically incorporated into COPII vesicle fluid phase. cis-Golgi to ER retrieval mechanism: cis-Golgi acidic pH promotes receptorKDEL interactions. Higher pH of ER → dissociates ER resident KDEL protein from the KDEL receptor. Retrieval system prevents depletion of ER luminal proteins. Processing of N-linked Oligosaccharide within cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi Cisternae © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p648 trans-Golgi: N-acetylneuraminic acids added (7). Galactoses added (6). medial-Golgi: Fucose added (5). Mannoses removed (3). N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAc) added (2 and 4). cis-Golgi: Mannoses removed (1). Anterograde transport occurs by cisternal maturation. Golgi cisternae have different enzymes. 14.4 Later Stages of the Secretory Pathway The trans-Golgi network sorts proteins into vesicles targeted for different destinations. Lysosomal enzymes bear M6P residues that are recognized by M6P-receptors and delivered by a clathrin-coated vesicle pathway to lysosomes. Regulated secretory proteins are concentrated and stored until secretion is signaled; constitutively secreted proteins are continuously delivered to the plasma membrane. Some proteins are processed into mature form after leaving the trans-Golgi network. Vesicle Trafficking from trans-Golgi Network © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p651 (5) Regulated secretory vesicles (unknown coat). (4) Constitutive secretory vesicles (unknown coat). (3) Clathrin-coated (+AP2) vesicles transport to late endosomes. (2) AP complex vesicles transport directly to lysosomes. (1) COPI vesicles: retrograde to trans-Golgi (cisternal progression). Distal sorting trans-Golgi network: transport vesicles to plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes. Dynamin Pinching Off of Clathrin-Coated Vesicles © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p652 Dynamin: Required for pinching off of clathrin-coated vesicles Polymerizes around vesicle neck Hydrolyzes GTP – conformational change coupled to membrane fusion and vesicle release from the donor membrane. GTP hydrolysis by dynamin is required for the pinching off of clathrin-coated vesicles (cells incubated with GTP-γ-S nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP). Formation of Mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) to Target Soluble Enzymes to Lysosomes © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p653 M6P signal directs newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes. Step 1: cis-Golgi-localized N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) phosphotransferase transfers a phosphorylated GlcNAc group to carbon 6 of one or more mannose residues. Step 2: Phosphodiesterase removes the GlcNAc group, leaving a 6-phosphorylated mannose residue on the lysosomal enzyme. Trafficking of Lysosomal Enzymes from trans-Golgi Network and Cell Surface to Lysosomes © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p654 M6P receptors in trans-Golgi membrane recruit M6P-lysosomal enzymes into clathrin/AP1-coated vesicles (1). Clathrin coat disassembles (2). Coat proteins recycled (2a). Vesicle fuses with late endosome compartment (3). Acidic pH dissociates M6P-enzyme from receptor. Late endosome fuses with a lysosome (4). M6P receptors recycled (4a). Some receptors are delivered to the cell surface (5a). Plasma membrane M6P receptors (5) capture missorted M6P-enzymes into clathrin-coated vesicles in the receptor-mediate endocytosis pathway (6). Deliver enzyme to endosome/lysosome (7-8) I Cell Disease: Mistargeting of Lysosomal Enzymes to Extracellular Matrix Lack of N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase activity. Lysosomal enzymes lack M6P targeting signal → constitutively secreted (5a). Continued accumulation of undigested lysosomal contents → forms “inclusions bodies”, may eventually kill cells. Causes developmental, physiological, and neurological abnormalities. Referred to as Mucolipidosis. In vitro “cure” – M6P-enzymes added to I-cell fibroblasts – internalized by endocytosis pathway and function on arrival in lysosomes. VERY EXPENSIVE. Proteolytic Processing of Proproteins in Constitutive / Regulated Secretory Pathways © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p657 Proproteins matured after leaving trans-Golgi.

Experiment: LDL particles (contain cholesterol): labeled with electron-dense, iron-containing ferritin protein (visible with EM) Cultured fibroblasts incubated with LDL-ferretin at 4°: LDL binds to LDL-receptors; endocytosis process is inhibited Cells warmed to initiate endocytosis. RME receptors: Some types cluster in clathrin-coated pits by cytoplasmic domain association with AP2 even in absence of ligand. Others types diffuse freely in the plasma membrane until a ligand-induced conformational change associates them with AP2. Two or more types of receptor-bound ligands, such as LDL and transferrin, can be present in the same coated pit/vesicle. Cellular Uptake / Degradation of LDL by RME © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p661 • LDL-LDL receptor complexes completely bound at membrane surface in AP2-clathrincoated pit. • Internalization of LDL-LDL receptor receptor increases as binding at cell surface decreases. • Degradation begins within 10-15 minutes, as internalization reached its maximum. Pulse-chase experiment demonstrates precursor-product relations in cellular uptake of LDL. Experiment: LDL labeled with 125I Cultured normal human skin fibroblasts – incubated with 125I-LDL for 2 hours at 4°C (pulse) – LDL binds to surface LDL receptors; not endocytosed Unbound LDL – washed away Shift to 37°C – activates RME (chase) Results: 125I-LDL rapidly disappears from surface (binding) by RME. 125I-LDL in internal vesicles rises coincidently. After a 15 min lag – 125I-LDL degradation in lysosomes increases.

Interacts with aqueous environment for transport in blood. • Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is ligand for LDL receptor. • Hydrophobic core is mostly cholesteryl esters/triglycerides (minor neutral lipids [vitamins]). Model of LDL Receptor and LDL Binding © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p663 (a) LDL receptor at neutral pH (binding LDL at cell surface): - Ligand binding arm seven cysteine-rich repeats (R1–R7) – tightly bind LDL apoB-100 (R4 and R5 – most critical for LDL binding) - Note receptor NPXY AP2- targeting cytosolic domain. (b) LDL receptor at acidic pH (releasing LDL in endosome): - β-propeller domain histidine residues become protonated. - Positively charged propeller domain binds negatively charged ligand-binding domain → release of LDL particle.

Down-regulation of LDL receptor Transferrin Cycle © Lodish, Molecular Cell Biology, Eight Edition, p664 Transferrin Cycle: Ferrotransferrin binds transferrin receptor at cell surface pH 7.0 (1). Transferrin receptor forms AP2 clathrin-coated vesicle → RME to late endosome (2-4). Acidic pH dissociates Fe3+ → Apotransferrin recycled to cell surface. Extracellular neutral pH, receptor releases apotransferrin. Fe3+ reduced to Fe2+ for use. Transferrin protein comes in two forms, apotransferrin (not bound to Fe3+) and Ferrotransferrin (carries Fe3+ in blood). Transferrin binding to transferrin receptor is pH-dependent: Receptor binds Ferrotransferrin at physiologic pH (pH ~7.0). Receptor binds Apotransferrin at lysosomal pH (pH ~5.0). RME endocytic pathway delivers iron to cells without dissociation of the transferrin–transferrin receptor complex in endosomes. Transferrin protein: Apotransferrin – no bound Fe3+ Ferrotransferrin – carries Fe3+ in blood Binds to transferrin receptor Uptake mechanism: Ferrotransferrin dimer with two Fe3+ binds tightly to transferrin receptor at the cell surface – ~pH 7.0. Transferrin receptor cytoplasmic tail interaction with an AP2 adapter complex – incorporates receptor-ligand complex into endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles Clathrin disassembly uncoats vesicle. Vesicle fuses with late endosome – acidic pH – Dissociates Fe3+ from ferrotransferrin – Fe3+ reduced to Fe2+ by endosome reductase Transported from endosome to cytoplasm Maintains apotransferrin-receptor complex Recycling of receptor-apotransferrin complex to the plasma membrane Extracellular neutral pH destabilizes complex – releases apotransferrin from receptor 14.6 Directing Membrane Proteins and Cytosolic Materials to the Lysosome ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) Endocytosed membrane proteins targeted for degradation in the lysosome are incorporated into vesicles that bud into the interior of the endosome. Cellular components (e.g., ESCRT) that mediate endosome membrane budding are used to pinch off enveloped viruses such as HIV from the plasma membrane of virus-infected cells.

Though, there are more than ten thousand, or even 100 thousand of Chinese character, they can all be classified into six types. Pictograms (象形), Simple ideograms (指事), Compound ideographs(会意), Rebus characters(假借), Phono-semantic compound characters (形声), and Derivative cognates(转注); Six days to know all types of Chinese character! Day 1: Pictograms Pictograms is the easiest one. As a pictograms, the character was looks like a photo draw by kids. 马(馬) is one of my favorite characters because it just looks like a horse. You can find the horse’s head, horsehair, four lags, and pony tail (If you can’t image that, please look the 1st photo). Other pictograms: 日月山川水火心牛羊鸟马犬虎彘象人田禾子女刀舌 Day 2: Simple ideograms Simple ideograms: They are a group of characters which were simply decorated pictograms. For example, “甘” is a dot or dash on the center of a tongue which means sweat. With the dot, the word had a new related meanings which became a new character. Similar character is “刃”, a dash on a knife, which means the edge of the knife. Other Simple ideograms: 一、二、三、四、末、亦 、本. Six days to know all types of Chinese characters! Day 3: Phono-semantic compound characters Phono-semantic compound characters (PCC, 形声字). PCC is a great invention because it greatly expended the variety of characters without complicating them. For example, “气” is gas. You can still guess that 氢, 氦, 氧, 氩 is some kind of gas because they looks like a gas. One of another key element is another part plays a role of phonetic symbol. 巠(jin) in 氢(qing), 亥(hai) in 氦(hai), 羊(yang) in 氧(yang), 亚(ya) in 氩(ya). As a result, you can figure out all the normal form of element in Periodic Table of Element. All characters with 气 is gas, characters with 金(钅, metal) is metal, characters with 石 (stone) is none-metal solid compound.

Day 4: compound characters Like the Phono-semantic compound character, compound ideographs has more than two components, too. But not like phono-semantic compound characters, all elements in this word are directly contributed to the meaning of the character. For example, what a 人(man) 言(said) is 信 (worthy to be trusted), 人(people) line a 木(tree) is for 休(rest). two 木(trees) is 林(a small woods), three 木(trees) is 森(forest), two (人)men is 从 (follow), three (人)men is 众(lots of man). Six days to know all types of Chinese characters! Day 5: Rebus characters (RC) After you learned Phono-semantic compound characters (PCC) you can easily remember the pronunciation PCC words like 证(zheng), 抖(dou), and 城(cheng) if you know 正(zheng), 斗(dou), and 成(cheng). But that not means some characters like 说(shuo), 脱(tuo), 悦(yue) pronounce as 兑(tui). The origin of this group of characters is more complicated than the previous. The story goes like, sometimes you have to describe the thing out of your dictionary but you can’t create a character sine others would seem it as a mistake. As a result, you choose to use an existing word to represent it. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish RC from PCC and even a Chinese would make mistakes. For example, I was spell 谙(an) as 音(yin) for a while until I can’t find it when I want to type it. 2021/04/22: 行 S1: “A: 你行不行? B:不行! A:不行也要行!! B: 真不行！难道你行? A: 当然行! B: 真行? A:真行!

There is another romantic story about the moon, which /where was a couple that became the goddivine and ran away tointo the moon forever. The woman had a rabbit with her. Because the light of the moon is as gentle and cold as a jade, ancient people also called the moon as the jade-frog (玉蟾), Ice-frog (冰蟾), or the jade-rabbit (玉兔). It also has another romantic name, Chan Juan (婵娟), which means gorgeous (娟) beauty(婵). So, you can use it to compliment the beauty of a womanwomen(美若婵娟). On the other hand, the Chinese calendar is based on the phases of the sun and the moon. The phase of the moon from one new moon to the next is a month. That’s why we have a full moon on the 15th of each month. WeBecuase of that, we also call a month as ‘one moon’(一个月). Some vocabulary of the moon: 月亮: Moon, 今晚的月亮很大.

Others thought that they had done this to prevent a mixture with other similar characters like mouth, which was a circle, too.

As knowledge and experience serve as two towers in problem-solving, one is often presented with two major paths that pave the way for final fulfillment, either to wrack his brain, just like what happened to Neuton, sitting for many years under an apple tree and eventually figuring out one of the greatest universal rules that govern the whole globe, or to seek for other’s wisdom through their advice, just as in the case of Benjamin Franklin, gathering great minds under one roof and then establishing a most world-renown library. Both ways work. When a practical goal is involved, however, Benjamin Franklin may best be regarded as a role model in this respect, and asking people for advice often turns out to be the primer alternative. Experience and knowledge borrowed or learned from others’ advice contribute greatly to the effectiveness and efficiency of a goal-accomplishment. Not all experience and knowledge related to problem-solving can be obtained by personal effort alone due to the limitation of the mind and capabilities of each individual. A single thought in someone’s mind is, more often than not, far less shining compared with the group’s wisdom. That explains the famous old saying that one sees further when standing on the shoulders of past great giants; that explains why a great leader is always with greater minds; that also explains why teamwork in cooperation is highly emphasized in the 21st century. Brainstorm and exchange of ideas between different thoughts never fail to enhance the capabilities of each individual involved, a team, a company, an institution, a country, or even the entire global village. Asking other’s advice instead of getting everything done on one’s own promotes democracy and communication too. In terms of democracy, it is necessary to give others rights and chance to speak since the problem may concern them in different ways, and their saying in turn reflects our respect toward freedom of speech as well as their wisdom. In terms of communication, idea exchange sometimes focuses more than solutions, and hereby better mutual understanding about perspectives, principles, practicalities, and personalities of each other. Admittedly turning to others for help and suggestion by no means refers to absolute and irresponsible dependence. Consideration upon different thoughts and ideas broadens our mind, enlarges our vision, furthers understanding, enhances more effective and efficient brainstorm, and stresses mutual respect in groups and communities, which undoubtedly gives rise to better, if not the best solutions. As is paraphrased from John F Kennedy, brainstormed, there is litter we cannot do while divided, there is little we can do. Back Home or Leave After Graduation Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben After they complete their university studies, some students live in their hometowns. Others live in different towns and cities. Which do you think is beterr? Give reasons for your answer. After they complete their university studies, some students prefer to live in their hometowns while others choose to live in different towns or cities. Everybody has his own hometowns or cities. Everybody has his own reason for his preference. After graduation, I will go back and live in my home city. I have made this decision because of the following reasons. Firstly, my home city is a big city that can offer a lot. There are plenty of opportunities for work, many big libraries for studies, several different museums for visit, and numerous cinemas, theaters, and centers for entertainment. When I go back there, I’ll have no difficulty in finding a job suitable for me and I can make use of all the facilities available there. Secondly, if I go back to my home city, I can look after my parents. I take this into consideration because I am their only child and they are now weak and getting on in age. If I live in the same city as them, I can visit them very often and help them whenever it is necessary. Thirdly, if I live in my home city, I will have a lot of friends, schoolmates, and relatives to visit and to turn to for help when I need it. Of course, I could get acquainted with many people and make many friends if I went to live in a strange place, but that takes time. If I go back to my home city, everybody will wait for me and I will be able to settle down comfortably without any trouble and waste of time. In short, my choice is based on careful consideration of my home city and my family. I think it’s a better and a sensible choice; in a certain sense, it is a must. Good Neighbor Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbor? Use specific details and examples in your answer. If you have a good neighbor, you are a lucky person. You have someone who cares about your needs and property, who is helpful in the little day-to-day situation that comes up, and who is supportive in times of crisis. A good neighbor is someone who, for instance, understands that your children may occasionally run across his lawn, even though you tell them not to. He’ll realize that children can be careless about things like that, and he won’t make a big fuss about it unless it becomes a regular thing. In the same vein, he knows that you’ll understand if some of the trash from his trash cans blows across into your yard. In other words, he is sensitive to the unintentional things that can happen. He doesn’t make a big deal about them. A good neighbor is also respectful of your property. For example, she asks your permission before doing anything that interferes with what’s yours. This means she wouldn’t plant a huge tree in between your house without asking how you felt about it. If she wanted to put up a fence, she would let you know first. She might work with you to decide where it should be placed. Maybe the two of you would even split the cost. A good neighbor would lend you some milk if you ran out. She’d give you a ride to work if your car was broken, and let your children stay at her house in the evening if you got stuck working overtime. You would do the same for her. Both of you would help make the other’s life easier. When something really awful happens to you, like a death in the family, a good neighbor will volunteer to help in any way he can. This could mean something small, like making some casseroles to put in your freezer to feed visiting relatives. Or it could mean something big, like helping you get through the sadness of the funeral. I think only someone who has experienced a bad neighbor can really appreciate a good one! A good neighbor can be a good friend. He or she can make all the difference in the world to your life. Eating Outside or at home Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and esamples to support your answer. Some people like to eat out at food stands and restaurants, while others like to prepare food at home. Often, it depends on the kind of lifestyle people have. Those with very busy jobs outside the house don’t always have time to cook. They like the convenience of eating out. Overall, though, it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home. While eating in restaurants is fast, the money you spend can add up. When I have diner at a restaurant with friends, the bill is usually over twenty dollars. I can buy a lot of groceries with that much money. Even lunch at a fast-food stand usually costs five or six dollars for one person. THat’s enough to feed the whole family at home. If you cook food at home, you have more control over the ingredients. You can use margarine instead of butter on your potatoes, or not put so much cheese on top of your pizza. At home, you can control your portion size. You can serve yourself as little as you want. In a restaurant, you may eat a full plate of food “because you paid for it”. It’s true that eating out is convenient. You don’t have to stop, or cook, or clean up. But real home cooking doesn’t have to take up a lot of time. There are lots of simple meals that don’t take long to make. In fact, they’re faster than eating out, especially if you think of the time you spend driving to a restaurant, parking, waiting for a table, waiting for service, and driving home. Both eating at restaurants and cooking at home can be satisfying. Both can taste good and be enjoyed with family and friends. I prefer cooking at home because of money and health issues. but people will make the choice that fits their lifestyle best. Personally, I prefer cooking at home for several reasons. Most people believe that eating at stands or restaurants is a kind of time-saving since we need to pro-process the foodstuffs, flavor and cook them, and clean everything up if we eat at home. It seems time-consuming than eating out. But that’s not quite true. There are more choices compared with eating outside and a quick meal is such an answer. For example, we can boil some noodles, vegetables, and eggs and flavoring them with sauces. It just takes 3 min to boil water, and 5 min to finish the cook. On the other hand, if you not satisfied with this, you can prepare more then one meal for each time just as I always did. So, for the next meal, it just takes 2 mins to heat it by microwave-oven. Compared to eating outside, I need to take time to pick a restaurant, make a very hard order since there are so many choices on the menu, wait for the service, and finally, eat it. If we hit a traffic jam or a long waiting list, it takes more. Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben Around the world, people gather to explore their emotions through dance. The dances are created as part of celebrations, as religious services, as preparation for challenging hunts and warfare and to express sorrow (less often than the other situations). Indeed, dance does play an important role within a culture and reveals a wide range of information about the characteristics of a culture. Three of the most revealing aspect of dance are the nature of the culture’s symbols and art forms revealed in costumes and equipment, the body language (moves and gestures) which give information about social contact behaviors, and frequently the style of preferred music for the culture. Ethnic dances, and certainly popular dance, anywhere around the world have associated preference for costumes and special clothing. Through dancing, the participants are able to reveal and express their chosen role in the garments they choose; social roles in the dance show publically to the observers as well as other dancers. Frequently dancers utilize objects like swords or sticks or hoops or musical instruments to further reveal information about their role in the social story portrayed in the dance. Items such as special headwear and jewelry are further examples of the garments that in general express preferences and culturally significant details about the particular culture. Dancers, by the very nature of the activity, physically express beliefs and attitudes associated with their specific culture. In many dances, the participants are modeling typical activities of their culture and thus imparting instructions and historical information to the audience. In other dances, one can see the expression of deep emotion: love, worship, grief, strength, anger, etc. and thus obtain clues about the inner feelings of the culture’s individuals. Dance provides an opportunity for others to witness some of the special behaviors associated with activities in the culture. Also, dance is a (usually) public statement so that observers can see how members of the culture treat those who are older members of the opposite sex, more respected members, etc. The third aspect of dance that reveals much about a culture is the music or singing that is typically a part of the event. Observers can see evidence of the type of instruments, characteristics of the culture, and who plays the instruments as well as how they are used – instruments may be associated only with special events and thus transmit valuable cultural information. Frequently, singing is part of a dance program, and again an observer has an opportunity to observe who is singing and the nature of the voices. I found this aspect of dance particularly fascinating during a brief time I spent in a rural village in Zimbabwe a few years ago. Dancing is indeed a very important aspect of any culture. It provides a communal opportunity for members of the culture to artistically express emotions while acting out typical activities and concerns in their world. For outsider observers, many valuable details about the culture are revealed. Live in a City or Town Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. The Advantages of City Life There are undeniable advantages to both lives in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter, and often friendly place to live. However, despite the advantages of small-town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons. First, life in the city is more convenient. More goods are available and stores are open later. Also, there is better public transportation so it is easier to get around. I can find almost everything I want easily in the city. Second, there are more ways to spend leisure time in the city. There are many places I can go to meet friends and have fun. The city often attracts the best teachers and companies. There is also a wider choice of jobs so it is easier to move up the career ladder. For all of these reasons, I prefer to live in the city, Although I sometimes miss the fresh air and quiet life of a small town, nothing can make up for the opportunities that the city offers me. If one wants to be successful, I believe the best place to live in the city. Agree or not: Success has nothing to do with luck. Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success.&quot; Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position. The Role of Luck in Success “When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success.” Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position. The Role of Luck in Success It has been said that when people succeed, it is because of hard work and that has nothing to do with luck. Although I believe that hard work is very important and is the surest way to success for most people, I must disagree with this statement. It cannot be denied that luck plays an important role in success. For example, many important discoveries have been made by accident. There have many cases of researchers and inventors making major breakthroughs while they are trying to solve another problem or create a different device. Furthermore, there is something to be said for simply being in the right place at the right time-perhaps meeting someone by chance who can offer a good job or rare opportunity. And of course, there are rare examples of gamblers and lottery winners who beat the odds and achieve sudden and unexpected success. While the influence of luck can not be ignored, this is not to say that one should depend on it and ignore the value of hard work. If one is willing to work hard, I believe that success will eventually be achieved, with or without the added benefit of luck. Moreover, hard work is often an essential ingredient of luck because it enables one to take advantage of a lucky encounter. If the scientist has not worked hard to developed his knowledge and skills, he may not recognize that lucky breakthrough when it comes along. Therefore, my suggestion is not to count on luck to bring you success. Instead, work hard and keep your eyes open for that lucky opportunity. Construction a Factory Near Your Community Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. do you support or oppose the factory? explain your position. Having a factory near where one lives brings with it both advantages and disadvantages. An obvious advantage is an increase in the number of jobs, and many people in the community might find employment in the new factory. The factory would bring money into the community in other ways as well. It would have to pay some taxes to the local government, and workers might go shopping or eat at restaurants in the area before or after their shits. However, the factory would bring some disadvantages, too. Depending on what kind of factory it is. It might pollute the environment and bring down property values. It would be sure to increase traffic in the area, causing congestion and making it unsafe for children to play outside. Finally, the neighborhood would become a noisy, busy place. For all of these reasons, I would be opposed to the construction of a new factory near my community. While the employment opportunities would help the community, I believe it would be better for residents to commute to work and preserve the peace of our neighborhood. Change one things in your hometown Copy from: 新东方在线 Proofreader: Karobben If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. My hometown is a large city with a dense population. Because it is crow people and vehicles, the environment is not as clean as I would like it to be. Too many cars and buses polluted the air and also people created a lot of garbage that is not always disposed of properly. If I could change just one thing about my hometown, it would be the environment. I would make it a cleaner and less polluted place to live. I believe that such a change is important because a person’s living environment greatly affects both his physical and mental health. Bad air quality can contribute to many health problems such as asthma, and improperly discarded garbage can spread bacteria that are dangerous to health. In addition, the environment can greatly affect the way a person feels. When in clean, attractive surroundings we always feel optimistic. For these reasons, I think the people of my hometown should work together to make it a cleaner place to live. In order to accomplish this goal, we have to not only enact laws to limit pollution but also take personal responsibility for our own actions. Only when people realize the effect that the environment has on their well-bing will they such proposals seriously. Therefore, ew must first inform people of the dangers of a poor environment. Then I believe we can all live happier, healthier lives.","link":"/2020/11/07/LearnNotes/writing/"},{"title":"Text Animation in Python","text":"Animation-Text class Signal: # &lt;1&gt; go = Truedef spin(msg, signal): # &lt;2&gt; write, flush = sys.stdout.write, sys.stdout.flush for char in itertools.cycle('|/-\\\\'): # &lt;3&gt; status = char + ' ' + msg write(status) flush() time.sleep(.1) write('\\x08' * len(status)) # &lt;4&gt; if not signal.go: break write(' ' * len(status) + '\\x08' * len(status)) # &lt;6&gt;def slow_function(): # &lt;7&gt; # pretend waiting a long time for I/O time.sleep(3) # &lt;8&gt; return 42def supervisor(): # &lt;9&gt; signal = Signal() spinner = threading.Thread(target=spin, args=('thinking!', signal)) print('spinner object:', spinner) # &lt;10&gt; spinner.start() # &lt;11&gt; result = slow_function() # &lt;12&gt; signal.go = False # &lt;13&gt; spinner.join() # &lt;14&gt; return resultdef main(): result = supervisor() # &lt;15&gt; print('Answer:', result)if __name__ == '__main__': main() PaddleGAN python -m pip install munch scikit-imagepython -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==2.2.2 import paddle#paddle.set_device('cpu')paddle.set_device('gpu')from ppgan.apps import DeOldifyPredictordeoldify = DeOldifyPredictor()pred = deoldify.run_image(&quot;/mnt/8A26661926660713/Deng/Cell_segmentation/lgl4wd5d1_c2.tif&quot;)pred.save('deoldify_result.jpg') $$\\frac{r_C×C +rG×G}{(1-r_{CG})(C+G)}=r_T$$ $C=53012;\\ r_C=38.27%$ $G=19742.5;\\ r_G=13%$ $TM=73304;\\ r_{T}=36.7%$ $r_{CG}=10.725%$ $(G+C)*(1-r_{CG})=64951.58$ $\\frac{38.27%×53012 + 13%19742.5}{(1-10.725%)(53012+19742.5)}≈38.811%$","link":"/2020/06/22/Python/Animation-Text/"},{"title":"Basmap","text":"Basmap 0.

If you wants to know why, go to check This blog So, if you want to write an app for windows, linux, IOS, and Android with only one set of code, then, Kivy is the best choice for you. Hello World first, you’d like to import kivy and from kivy.app import App; Then, you’d like from kivy.uix.label import Label so you can add some text Add kivy.require(&quot;1.10.1&quot;) to assign the version of the kivy. (PS: actually, mine is 1.11.1) Then, we can start to class a class EpicApp(App) import kivyfrom kivy.app import Appfrom kivy.uix.label import Label # so you can add some textkviy.require(&quot;1.10.1&quot;) # Assign the version of the kivy so every body would be on the same pageclass EpicApp(App): ''' After class, we'd like to initializing the App''' def build(self): return Label(text=&quot;Hello world&quot;)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: EpicApp().run() So, it’ll be your first kivy app! It is not interesting at all, actually. So, Let’s move one for GridLayout GridLayout Now, let’s add from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout to import the Layout style for organizing sort of things; from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput to add a TextInput box. Now, Our class are becoming more complicated So, during the initiation in build section, we not return to a simple text Label anymore. Let’s say, to return to a class named ConnectPage.

Besides, he showed us how to get the input texts from the TextInput In this video, Sant introduced the module of screenmanager from kivy.uix. Main skeleton of the codes: import kivyfrom kivy.app import Appfrom kivy.uix.label import Labelfrom kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout## to use buttons:from kivy.uix.button import Button## to screenfrom kivy.uix.screenmanager import ScreenManager, Screenkivy.require(&quot;1.10.1&quot;)class EpicApp(App):class ConnectPage(GridLayout):class InfoPage(GridLayout):if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: chat_app = EpicApp() chat_app.run() EpicApp() As you can see, there are three classes. In the first class, EpicApp, is the class which manager different screens. class EpicApp(App): def build(self): # We are going to use screen manager, so we can add multiple screens # and switch between them self.screen_manager = ScreenManager() # Initial, connection screen (we use passed in name to activate screen) # First create a page, then a new screen, add page to screen and screen to screen manager self.connect_page = ConnectPage() screen = Screen(name='Connect') screen.add_widget(self.connect_page) self.screen_manager.add_widget(screen) # Info page # Info page was below self.info_page = InfoPage() screen = Screen(name='Info') screen.add_widget(self.info_page) self.screen_manager.add_widget(screen) return self.screen_manager After assigned the screen_manger, we need to assign the “name” and “widget” on each screen; and then, add them into screen_manager As we can see, it loaded the ConnectPage first, and named it as ‘Connect’ which was used to switch the screen later. Who loaded first would be the Home Page. ConnectPage class ConnectPage(GridLayout): # runs on initialization # Our Main Screen def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) self.cols = 1 # used for our grid self.add_widget(Label(text='Hello World')) # widget #1, top left #self.add_widget(self.ip) # widget #2, top right # add our button. self.join = Button(text=&quot;Try me&quot;) self.join.bind(on_press=self.join_button) self.add_widget(Label()) # just take up the spot. self.add_widget(self.join) def join_button(self, instance): #print(f&quot;Joining {ip}:{port} as {username}&quot;) # Create info string, update InfoPage with a message and show it info = f&quot;You found me&quot; chat_app.info_page.update_info(info) chat_app.screen_manager.current = 'Info' The layout of this page was clearly explained by Sant. And for practicing, I simplified it and remained a line of text and button only. The button is the key to join another screen. The trick of it is create a brand new screen. InfoPage class InfoPage(GridLayout): def __init__(self, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) # Just one column self.cols = 1 # And one label with bigger font and centered text self.message = Label(halign=&quot;center&quot;, valign=&quot;middle&quot;, font_size=30) # By default every widget returns it's side as [100, 100], it gets finally resized, # but we have to listen for size change to get a new one # more: https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues/1044 self.message.bind(width=self.update_text_width) # Add text widget to the layout self.add_widget(self.message) # add our button. # Add an return button self.join = Button(text=&quot;return&quot;) self.join.bind(on_press=self.join_button) self.add_widget(Label()) # just take up the spot. self.add_widget(self.join) def join_button(self, instance): #print(f&quot;Joining {ip}:{port} as {username}&quot;) chat_app.screen_manager.current = 'Connect' # Called with a message, to update message text in widget def update_info(self, message): self.message.text = message # Called on label width update, so we can set text width properly - to 90% of label width def update_text_width(self, *_): self.message.text_size = (self.message.width * 0.9, None) In this page, Sant add a function which could update the texts in the screen. So we can print the texts by running chat_app.info_page.update_info(info) before switch to the screen ‘Info’ And personally, I add a return button to back to the home page.

The cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc() function takes four characters as input to create a fourcc code. In this case, the four characters are 'M', 'J', 'P', and 'G', which correspond to the MPEG-1 codec. So the fourcc variable will hold the fourcc code for the MPEG-1 codec, which will be used when writing the video file.

The code first defines the VideoWriter object with the desired filename, codec, frame rate, and frame size. Then, it iterates through each image in img_list, converts it to grayscale (if it isn’t already), and writes it to the video using the write method of the VideoWriter object. Finally, it releases the VideoWriter object to close the video file. vedio to gif from cv2 import cv2import imageioimport numpy# Collection of the imgsframes_list = []# Tossed frames per FPS.

Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It’s particularly suited for anyone who works with data. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes. Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to VMs or Kubernetes clusters and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready. There is a lot behind the framework. Plotly develops Dash and also offers a platform for writing and deploying Dash apps in an enterprise environment. If you’re interested, please get in touch.

By giving an id as my-input, it could be called back. After we added it in a thread @app.callback, it can update automatically whenever you made a change. For adding more callback widgets, we can add, Dropdown widgets for instance, and show the result on a new line. We can’t add the Input&amp;Output in the old thread directly. But we can add it in a new thread. Two things for callback functions: A threads is paired with function behind. The parameters in the function following the order of the Input from the @ threads. When you paired a thread and function, the like below: @app.callback( Output(&quot;id1&quot;, 'data') Input(&quot;id2&quot;, 'value') Input(&quot;id3&quot;, 'data'))def update(P1, P2): P3 = P1 + P2 return P3 In this result, it would accepts the data from widget ‘id3’ and ‘id2’.

It divided the nodes to “core point”; “border point”, and “outlier point” By given the pre-assigned diameters (of the sphere) and number of the adjacent nodes, it scan the nodes randomly. The node fit our expectation is core node. The node failed to achieve the expectation but adjacent to the core point(a) is border point. Rest of nodes are outlier points The advantage of DBscan is Outlier points (Noises) is tolerated. (Unlike k-means) It can detect the cluster under a cluster.

新手入门避坑指南","text":"Kivy 新手入门避坑指南 个人说说使用kivy的原因： 不会java, 不会C， 不会。。。 简而言之， 除了python, 啥也不会。但是又想写点 android 的apk. 所以， kivy成了我唯一的选择了。。。 在此奉劝， 如果只是一开发安卓apk为主要目的， 还是不要用比较好。 虽然kivy的买点在跨平台， 但是实际上， 平台夸起来， 很吃力。 我说说我现在的进展吧： （针对安卓） requests 库基本没问题 Opencv 不完美。 可以配合摄像头做人脸识别等但是无法读取视频。 可以输出视频，但是格式有限制。 imageio 输出gif PIL 基本没什么问题 numpy ok 可开启http服务 可调用android web浏览器（java） 目前来说， 其实已经可以做很多事情了。不过得自己注意，电脑和安卓之间的兼容问题。 开始前的避坑 python 版本 都2021年了， 不会真的还有人在用python2吧？？ 不会吧不会吧不会吧？？？ 请赶紧退坑， 谢谢。 python3 也不能乱用。 之前我用的 3.7.6， 然后打包request之后， 能用， 但是再出结果之后， 就会崩溃闪退。 我也不知道为啥。最后更具stack overflow 的解释， 换上了3.7.5， 就完全没问题了。 真的很奇奇怪怪= = 但是- - 目前我还是用的， 3.7.6。。。为什么？ 俺也不知道。反正：不要用最新的不要用3.9，更加不要用4。 不听的老人言， 吃亏在眼前 kivy和kivymd版本 Kivy和kivymd版本倒是没这么多的肯。 但是，md的坑是真大。 如果用错了版本， 你就会发现， 官方文档好多是“错的”！！更不不能运行。 其实官方文档怎么会有问题呢？ 动动脚趾头嘛？当然不会啦！ 对一下版本号就知道了。 切换版本以后， 就好。所以， 版本可以瞎用， 自己明白就好 另外， kivy和kivymd版本， 自己瞎用无所谓， 但请一定记得， 测试和打包的版本，保持一致。 不然， 到时候肯定会有问题的。 开始不会怎么样= = 东西多了复杂就会发现， 电脑和手机结果， 不一样， 甚至手机直接闪退 = = 打包 buildozer 打包hello world, 还是很方便的， 尤其是环境准备好之后， 再次打包就简单快了。 对于国内来说， 打包大部分失败的原因都是， 网络链接问题， 下载失败。所以， 没事的话， 先多重复几次， 然后盯一下卡在了哪里。 一般是先卡很久， 然后才会报错。 更复杂的东西， 比如打包opencv, 需要自己给sdk, 这个就麻烦了。 不过也只是第一次麻烦， 会了以后， 其实蛮简单的。 有些东西， 是真的没发打包= =（打包了也没法用）可能需要更特殊手段。 这就看大家大显神通了 报错 如果在电脑端运行的报错， 都看不懂的话， 那真的， 求你了， 放弃kivy吧。你大概适合换一个饭碗\\兴趣。python的错误， 都是精确到具体哪一行哪一個函数的说- - adb logcat 安卓报错 adb 报错的话， 一般来说， 也是python的运行问题。 如果这样的话， 只要在日至里搜寻 I python 就好。 对于linux, 可以直接adb logcat| grep &quot;I python&quot;再复杂的话， 就可以看看 I python 前面的编号，然后抓去这一个ID, 就可以获得这个程序所有的 adb log 了。但是这个内容报错- - 就会比较复杂了 = = 反正我是看不懂的。 贴上 stack overflow 也从来没有被回答过- - 我贴的几个= = 好难呀。 路径 安卓文件安装后， 会在/data目录下创建该app的文件夹。你在使用对应app的时候，是有读写权限的。 但是在其他地方， 比如自带的文件管理器， 对该app没有任何读写权限。 所以， 你的把想保存的东西放在别的地方。 用户自己有读写权限的根目录， 一般为/storage/emulated/0。 icon-font 消失 请加入字体 sdl2_ttf==2.0.15 在 requirements那里 kivy 及其打包环境快速配置 首先， 这是我的系统环境： ██████████████████ ████████ ken@manjaro ██████████████████ ████████ OS: Manjaro 21.0.5 Ornara ██████████████████ ████████ Kernel: x86_64 Linux 5.4.118-1-MANJARO

64042MiB 这里， 根据 john100 2021 在 arch 论坛的建议， 直接先安装 python 3.7.6， 然后配置一个虚拟环境 安装 Python cd /usr/localsudo wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/Python-3.7.6.tar.xzsudo tar xf Python-3.7.6.tar.xzcd Python-3.7.6sudo ./configure --enable-optimizationssudo make altinstallsudo rm -rf ../Python*xz kivy 和buildozer 这里我用力清华镜像。 但是清华镜像好像不稳定。 有时候， 直接下载还快。 python3.7 -m pip install -i

android-tools. 不同平台安装不一样。 我的是manjaro cd ~# install adbsudo pamac install android-tools, dpkg# install javasudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk-headless jre8-openjdk jdk8-openjdk openjdk8-doc openjdk8-src# Make invironment for some python librarysudo pacman -S cmakesource kivyven/bin/activate# enter the working directory thenbuildozer android debug deploy run 然后就可以直接打包测试了。找个hello world 的帖子， 然后直接打包网络没啥问题的话， 就直接成功啦！ 有些小问题， 记录在 Karobben Blog了 关于安装 sdk为了打包opencv, 也放哪里了 其他 打包 opencv：我的博客 上手项目练习：简单工具箱 关于报错：如何看kivy的报错 所有的kivy 帖子： Kivy 合集 项目展示 inclem.net 介绍了3款完成度非常高的精美kivyapp（本人没有上手测试）， 分别为 Boardz (滑雪游戏)

It seems the new version of buildozer updated the SDK tools and no longer supports packing the OpenCV with the default setting. So, we should settle the SDK by ourselves. What can we do with OpenCV in Android: loading/writing images writing videos (some formats like avi) facial detection with the camera opened by kivy What we can’t do: loading videos open cameras update images under threading (display) Abilities of OpenCV were limited in android.

But I do not suggest you do this since there is too much unrelated information If you have are familiar with adb, you may add a filter-args like adb logcat *:W. But this is not the case for Kivy because most of the information is in *:I level. As a result, pipeline adblog with grep is the best choice which could solve most of your problem. Here is my advice: # it could cover 99% casesadb logcat| grep -i python# it could help you access a more elegant result which cover the most of errors.adb logcat| grep -w &quot;I python&quot; adb logcat| grep -i python could access all information containing python. grep -w &quot;I python&quot; should more focus on the running log of python-android.

But for newbies, it is easy to write an unworking widget due to a lack of understanding of it.

So, to have a functional scrolling behavior, you’d like to make sure the sub-widget is larger than the ScrollView widget. Let’s go back to the example from the document: ScrollView: do_scroll_x: False do_scroll_y: True Label: size_hint_y: None height: self.texture_size[1] text_size: self.width, None padding: 10, 10 text: 'really some amazing text\\n' * 100 In this kv file, two lines are important to redefine the height of this sub-widget. size_hint_y: Noneheight: self.texture_size[1] The problem is self.texture_size[1] is for text only. You’d like to replace it with an int, 1000, for example. But of course, there is a better resolution from @amd, 2015 height: self.minimum_height An example could show as: ScrollView: size: 300, 20 do_scroll_x: False do_scroll_y: True BoxLayout: size_hint_y: None height: self.minimum_height padding: 10, 10 MyButton: text: 'hit me 1' MyButton: text: 'hit me 2' MyButton: text: 'hit me 3' MyButton: text: 'hit me 4' MyButton: text: 'hit me 5' MyButton: text: 'hit me 6' Case closed!!!","link":"/2021/02/10/Python/kivy_scrollview/"},{"title":"Kivy: import android Onlu on android","text":"You may see error code below when you try to import android in your PC.

We add nodes to the graph using G.add_nodes_from(), and add edges to the graph using G.add_edges_from(). We can assign a weight to each edge using a dictionary, but in this example we don’t do that. We then use the nx.spring_layout() function to generate node positions for the graph. This function positions nodes using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm. In this example, we set the random seed to 123 using the seed parameter of nx.spring_layout(). This ensures that the initial conditions of the spring layout algorithm are the same each time you run the code, and the layout of the graph remains the same. We then use nx.draw_networkx() to draw nodes and edges of the graph with labels. We also use nx.get_edge_attributes() and nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels() to add labels to the edges of the graph. Finally, we use plt.show() to display the plot. After displaying the graph, we use nx.shortest_path() to find the shortest path from node ‘A’ to node ‘H’. The function returns a list of nodes that form the path. We print the path to the console. Note that you can modify the graph and the path-finding algorithms according to your specific needs using the functions available in the NetworkX library. How does nx.shortest_path works The nx.shortest_path() function in NetworkX is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses the Dijkstra’s algorithm, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. The nx.shortest_path() function takes three parameters: G: the graph to search for shortest path in. source: the starting node for the path. target: the ending node for the path. The function returns a list of nodes in the shortest path from the source node to the target node. what is Dijkstra’s algorithm Dijkstra’s algorithm is a graph search algorithm that works by finding the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph. The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes and a set of unvisited nodes, with the distance from the starting node to each unvisited node initialized to infinity. At each step, the algorithm selects the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the starting node and adds it to the visited set. It then updates the distances of all adjacent nodes that are still in the unvisited set, setting their distance to the sum of the distance to the current node and the weight of the edge between them. The algorithm continues until the target node is reached, or until all nodes have been visited. Once the shortest path has been found, nx.shortest_path() returns a list of nodes in the path, in the order that they appear in the path. What is “bellman-ford”? Bellman-Ford is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph. The algorithm can handle negative edge weights, whereas Dijkstra’s algorithm, which we discussed in a previous question, cannot. However, Bellman-Ford is slower than Dijkstra’s algorithm and has a higher time complexity of O(V*E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The Bellman-Ford algorithm works by relaxing all edges in the graph V-1 times, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. During each iteration, the algorithm checks if the distance to a node can be improved by going through another node. If so, it updates the distance to the node. The algorithm repeats this process V-1 times to ensure that all possible paths have been explored. After the V-1 iterations, the algorithm performs one more check to see if there are any negative weight cycles in the graph. If there are, then the algorithm cannot find a shortest path because the distance to the node can be decreased indefinitely by traversing the negative cycle. In this case, the algorithm returns a message indicating that a negative cycle has been detected. import networkx as nx# Create a graphG = nx.DiGraph()# Add nodesG.add_nodes_from(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])# Add edges with weightsG.add_weighted_edges_from([('A', 'B', 3), ('A', 'C', 8), ('B', 'C', -4), ('B', 'D', 1), ('B', 'E', 7), ('C', 'D', 2), ('D', 'B', 2), ('E', 'D', -5)])# Find the shortest paths using Bellman-Ford algorithmdistances, predecessors = nx.bellman_ford(G, 'A')# Print the distancesprint(distances)# Print the predecessorsprint(predecessors) In this example, we create a directed graph with five nodes and eight edges, with some edges having negative weights. We then use nx.bellman_ford() to find the shortest paths from the node ‘A’ to all other nodes in the graph. The function returns two dictionaries: one with the shortest distance from the starting node to each node, and another with the predecessor node in the shortest path for each node. We print these dictionaries to the console. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/02/26/Python/net-path/"},{"title":"Opencv add a Progress Bar for video| Python","text":"Opencv Progress Bar Prepare your video, gif, png Sample progress bar We can use a rectangle to be the progress bar import cv2 as cv2# Vdieo sourceVideo = &quot;/run/media/ken/Data/Vlog/Tank_rasbbery/test.avi&quot;cap=cv2.VideoCapture(Video)Video_w = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)frame_total = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)Num = 0print(frame_total, Num)while Num &lt;= frame_total-1: #

Here we are using the RootSIFT rather then standard SIFT which requires cv2.xfeatures2d module. What’s the difference between them? SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is an algorithm used to detect and describe local features in images. It was developed by David Lowe in 1999 and is widely used in computer vision applications, such as image matching, object recognition, and stitching. The key advantages of SIFT are its scale and rotation invariance, as well as its robustness to changes in illumination and viewpoint. RootSIFT is an extension of SIFT proposed by Arandjelović and Zisserman in 2012. The main idea behind RootSIFT is to improve the performance of the original SIFT descriptor by applying a simple element-wise square root normalization to the descriptor values. This normalization helps to better differentiate between descriptors and improves matching performance, especially in scenarios where the distribution of descriptor distances is heavily skewed. The best scenarios for each method: Standard SIFT: General-purpose feature detection and description Applications where scale and rotation invariance are required Object recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction RootSIFT: Improved performance in scenarios with skewed descriptor distance distributions Better differentiation between descriptors for more accurate matching Applications where a more discriminative descriptor is needed In summary, RootSIFT is an improvement over standard SIFT in terms of descriptor matching performance. It is especially useful in scenarios where the distribution of descriptor distances is heavily skewed, and a more discriminative descriptor is required. However, for general-purpose feature detection and description, the standard SIFT algorithm is still widely applicable. © ChatGPT4 Similarity by machine learning model import numpy as npfrom keras.preprocessing import imagefrom keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_inputfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similaritydef load_and_preprocess_image(image_path): img = image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)) img_array = image.img_to_array(img) img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) return preprocess_input(img_array)def extract_features(img_array, model): return model.predict(img_array)def calculate_similarity(feature_vector1, feature_vector2): return cosine_similarity(feature_vector1, feature_vector2)# Load the pre-trained VGG16 modelmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, pooling='avg')# Load and preprocess the imagesimage1_path = '1.png'image2_path = '2.png'image1 = load_and_preprocess_image(image1_path)image2 = load_and_preprocess_image(image2_path)# Extract high-level features from both imagesfeature_vector1 = extract_features(image1, model)feature_vector2 = extract_features(image2, model)# Calculate the cosine similarity between the feature vectorssimilarity_score = calculate_similarity(feature_vector1, feature_vector2)print('Similarity score:', similarity_score[0][0]) Similarity score: 0.9361447 How it work? It compare the similarities of the images is by using a pre-trained deep learning model VGG16 to extract high-level features from both images and then calculate the cosine similarity between these features. Here’s an example of how you can do this using Keras with TensorFlow backend: What is VGG16 (From ChatGPT4) VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture proposed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It was introduced by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in their 2014 paper, “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition” VGG16 contains 16 weight layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. It was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 14 million images belonging to 1,000 different classes. The primary purpose of VGG16 is for image classification, where it has achieved top performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). However, its learned features can also be used for various other tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and image similarity comparison, as demonstrated in the previous code example. Merits of using VGG16 for image similarity comparison: Pre-trained models: VGG16 is pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet), so it has already learned high-level features that can be useful for a wide range of tasks, including image similarity comparison. Transfer learning: Since VGG16 has already learned high-level features, you can use it as a feature extractor for your images without having to train the model from scratch. Robustness: VGG16 can extract features that are robust to variations in scale, rotation, and translation, making it suitable for comparing images with different sizes and orientations. Disadvantages of using VGG16 for image similarity comparison: Computational complexity: VGG16 has a large number of parameters, which can make it computationally expensive to use, especially on devices with limited computational resources. This can be a concern if you need to process a large number of images or require real-time processing. Model size: The model size of VGG16 is relatively large (around 528 MB), which can be a concern if you have limited storage or need to deploy the model on edge devices. Newer models available: Since the introduction of VGG16, several more advanced architectures have been proposed, such as ResNet, Inception, and EfficientNet, which can achieve better performance with less computational complexity and smaller model sizes. In summary, while VGG16 can be used effectively for image similarity comparison, its computational complexity and model size might be a concern for certain applications or devices.

The description parameter allows you to set a text description for the task that is displayed next to the progress bar.

By comparing the raw image, we can also get the gray intensity or so. But of course, we are not just want to do the basic counts like that. We’d like to do more. In this post, I’ll show how to plot the cell based on the mask result, label the ID of each cell, calculate the Voronoi spacial, and finally determine the adjacent cells. More related techniques would be updated if I had some new ideas and tasks.

RNNs are an extension of regular artificial neural networks that add connections feeding the hidden layers of the neural network back into themselves - these are called recurrent connections. The recurrent connections provide a recurrent network with visibility of not just the current data sample it has been provided, but also it’s previous hidden state. A recurrent network with a feedback loop can be visualized as multiple copies of a neural network, with the output of one serving as an input to the next. Unlike traditional neural networks, recurrent nets use their understanding of past events to process the input vector rather than starting from scratch every time. A RNN is particularly useful when a sequence of data is being processed to make a classification decision or regression estimate but it can also be used on non-sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are typically used to solve tasks related to time series data. Applications of recurrent neural networks include natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, character-level language modeling, image classification, image captioning, stock prediction, and financial engineering. We can teach RNNs to learn and understand sequences of words. RNNs can also be used to generate sequences mimicking everything from Shakespeare to Linux source code, to baby names. © NVDIA Recurrent neural networks have memory to remember important past events, which is essential for successful sequence learning. Regular neural networks have fixed input size, while recurrent networks can handle sequences of any length. They process each element of a sequence one at a time, making them suitable for processing sequential data. A Sample Example There is an example from Abid Ali Awan, 2022. The training data is from kaggle MasterCard Stock Data # Importing the librariesimport numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScalerfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_errorfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequentialfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout, GRU, Bidirectionalfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGDfrom tensorflow.random import set_seedset_seed(455)np.random.seed(455)# Read the datadataset = pd.read_csv( &quot;/home/ken/Downloads//Mastercard_stock_history.csv&quot;, index_col=&quot;Date&quot;, parse_dates=[&quot;Date&quot;]).drop([&quot;Dividends&quot;, &quot;Stock Splits&quot;], axis=1)print(dataset.head()) Open High Low Close Volume Date 2006-05-25 3.748967 4.283869 3.739664 4.279217 395343000 2006-05-26 4.307126 4.348058 4.103398 4.179680 103044000 2006-05-30 4.183400 4.184330 3.986184 4.093164 49898000 2006-05-31 4.125723 4.219679 4.125723 4.180608 30002000 2006-06-01 4.179678 4.474572 4.176887 4.419686 62344000 This code is for visualizing the training and testing data. We use the data from the previous year as the training data to predict the data for the last four years. tstart = 2016tend = 2020def train_test_plot(dataset, tstart, tend): dataset.loc[f&quot;{tstart}&quot;:f&quot;{tend}&quot;, &quot;High&quot;].plot(figsize=(16, 4), legend=True) dataset.loc[f&quot;{tend+1}&quot;:, &quot;High&quot;].plot(figsize=(16, 4), legend=True) plt.legend([f&quot;Train (Before {tend+1})&quot;, f&quot;Test ({tend+1} and beyond)&quot;]) plt.title(&quot;MasterCard stock price&quot;) plt.show()train_test_plot(dataset,tstart,tend) Detailed explain The code defines a function `train_test_plot` that takes in a dataset, a start year `tstart`, and an end year `tend`. It plots the `High` column of the dataset for the years between `tstart` and `tend`, and the `High` column of the dataset for the years after `tend+1`. This function is then called with the `dataset`, `tstart`, and `tend` variables that were previously defined from reading in the Mastercard stock history data. The resulting plot shows the trend of the Mastercard stock price for the years before `tend+1` (train data) and the years after `tend+1` (test data). The plot helps to visualize how the dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation. def train_test_split(dataset, tstart, tend): train = dataset.loc[f&quot;{tstart}&quot;:f&quot;{tend}&quot;, &quot;High&quot;].values test = dataset.loc[f&quot;{tend+1}&quot;:, &quot;High&quot;].values return train, testtraining_set, test_set = train_test_split(dataset, tstart, tend)sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))training_set = training_set.reshape(-1, 1)training_set_scaled = sc.fit_transform(training_set)def split_sequence(sequence, n_steps): X, y = list(), list() for i in range(len(sequence)): end_ix = i + n_steps if end_ix &gt; len(sequence) - 1: break seq_x, seq_y = sequence[i:end_ix], sequence[end_ix] X.append(seq_x) y.append(seq_y) return np.array(X), np.array(y)n_steps = 60features = 1# split into samplesX_train, y_train = split_sequence(training_set_scaled, n_steps)# Reshaping X_train for modelX_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0],X_train.shape[1],features) Detailed explain The code defines several functions to prepare the dataset for training the RNN model. The train_test_split function takes in the dataset, tstart, and tend variables and returns the High column values of the dataset for the years between tstart and tend as the training set and the High column values of the dataset for the years after tend+1 as the test set. The MinMaxScaler function from sklearn.preprocessing is used to scale the training_set values between 0 and 1. Then, the split_sequence function is defined to split the training set into input-output sequences of length n_steps. This function takes in a sequence and the number of time steps to split the sequence into. Next, n_steps and features are defined as 60 and 1, respectively. The split_sequence function is then called to split the training_set_scaled into X_train (input sequences) and y_train (output sequences) for the RNN model. Finally, X_train is reshaped to a 3D tensor to match the input shape required by the RNN model, with dimensions (number of samples, number of time steps, number of features). The number of samples is inferred from the input data, number of time steps is set to n_steps, and number of features is set to 1. In this code, we only focus on the “High” column. After splitting the data into training_set and test_set using a predefined function, they are still one-dimensional with lengths of 1259 and 195, respectively. Next, we need to reshape the training set and scale it using MinMaxScaler. We then define a number of steps (n_steps) for the input sequence. This is similar to defining a sliding window, with the window size determined by the number of steps. Based on the features of this window, we can predict the information beyond the window.

First, the code splits the dataset into training and testing sets using a specified time period. It then applies feature scaling to the training set using MinMaxScaler, which scales the data to a range between 0 and 1. The function split_sequence is defined to prepare the training data into input-output pairs. Given a sequence of data points, this function divides the data into input sequences (X) of length n_steps and the corresponding output values (y). The LSTM model is defined using the Sequential class from Keras. It has one LSTM layer with 125 units and a tanh activation function. The output from the LSTM layer is then passed to a Dense layer with one unit. The model is compiled with the RMSprop optimizer and mean squared error (mse) loss function. After defining the model, the training set is used to fit the model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32. Next, the testing set is prepared by selecting the required number of time steps from the end of the dataset, scaling it, and then splitting it into input-output pairs using the same split_sequence function. The input sequence is then reshaped into a 3D format that can be input into the LSTM model. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on the testing set, and the predictions are inverse transformed to get the actual stock prices. GRU Model model_gru = Sequential()model_gru.add(GRU(units=125, activation=&quot;tanh&quot;, input_shape=(n_steps, features)))model_gru.add(Dense(units=1))# Compiling the RNNmodel_gru.compile(optimizer=&quot;RMSprop&quot;, loss=&quot;mse&quot;)model_gru.summary()model_gru.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32)GRU_predicted_stock_price = model_gru.predict(X_test)GRU_predicted_stock_price = sc.inverse_transform(GRU_predicted_stock_price)plot_predictions(test_set, GRU_predicted_stock_price)return_rmse(test_set,GRU_predicted_stock_price) Detailed explain The code is defining and training a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model for predicting stock prices. First, the model is defined using the Keras Sequential API. The model has one GRU layer with 125 units and “tanh” activation function, and a Dense output layer with one unit. The model is then compiled using “RMSprop” optimizer and “mse” loss function. The model is trained using the training data, X_train and y_train, with 50 epochs and a batch size of 32. Then, the model is used to predict the stock prices for the test set using the predict method. The predicted prices are then inverse-transformed using the MinMaxScaler to obtain the actual stock prices. Finally, the predicted prices are plotted against the actual prices using the plot_predictions function and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is computed using the return_rmse function.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA, also known as Multidimensional Scaling, MDS) are both techniques used for dimensionality reduction, which is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. However, they are used in different contexts and have different underlying methodologies. PCA is a technique that is used when you have a multivariate data set and you want to identify new variables that will represent the variability of your entire data set as much as possible. The new variables, or principal components, are linear combinations of the original variables. PCA operates on a covariance (or correlation) matrix, which implies that it is a parametric method. On the other hand, PCoA is a method used in ecology and biology to transform a matrix of distances (or dissimilarities) between samples into a new set of orthogonal axes, the most important of which can be plotted against each other. PCoA can be applied to any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. Unlike PCA, PCoA is non-parametric and makes no assumptions about the distribution of the original variables. So, the main difference lies in the type of data they work with: PCA works with the actual data matrix and is used when you have a set of observations and measurements, while PCoA works with a matrix of pairwise distances and is used when you have a set of pairwise dissimilarities (like geographical distances between cities or genetic distances between individuals or species). © ChatGPT4 Interesting","link":"/2020/06/23/R/PCA/"},{"title":"Ploty","text":"Ploty Quick Start install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;)library(plotly)library(ggplot2)p &lt;- ggplot(df) + geom_point(ase(x=X,y=Y))P &lt;- ggplotly(p) Save library(htmlwidgets)saveWidget(P,&quot;1.html&quot;,selfcontained = F) More","link":"/2020/06/20/R/Ploty/"},{"title":"GGplot in Github","text":"GGplot in Github Update by: 2020/1/20Sort by stars tidyverse/ggplot2 4.2k(stars) thomasp85/gganimate 1.4k jrnold/ggthemes 1k thomasp85/ggraph 694 slowkow/ggrepel 694 rstudio/ggvis 661 cttobin/ggthemr 597 dkahle/ggmap 564 kassambara/ggpubr 532 thomasp85/ggforce 493 hrbrmstr/ggalt 483 sinhrks/ggfortify 415 YuLab-SMU/ggtree 381 davidgohel/ggiraph 360 ggobi/ggally 320 calligross/ggthemeassist 316 yutannihilation/gghighlight 313 nanxstats/ggsci 310 eclarke/ggbeeswarm 301 clauswilke/ggjoy 299 EmilHvitfeldt/ggpage 290 wilkelab/ggridges 288 daattali/ggExtra 255 gadenbuie/ggpomological 252 malcolmbarrett/ggdag 237 echen/ggplot2-tutorial 236 ricardo-bion/ggtech 236 vqv/ggbiplot 229 strengejacke/ggeffects 220 jespermaag/gganatogram 213 const-ae/ggsignif 210 paleolimbot/ggspatial 202 corybrunson/ggalluvial 199 jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial 198 LKremer/ggpointdensity 187 AtherEnergy/ggTimeSeries 183 lionel-/ggstance 182 ricardo-bion/ggradar 180 dill/emoGG 170 wilkox/ggfittext 169 briatte/ggnet 167 AliciaSchep/gglabeller 150 oswaldosantos/ggsn 133 wilkox/gggenes 124 eliocamp/ggnewscale 124 erocoar/gghalves 122 lepennec/ggwordcloud 118 omarwagih/ggseqlogo 116 RobWHickman/ggparliament 116 clauswilke/ggtextures 112 ehrlinger/ggRandomForests 108 martin-borkovec/ggparty 105 const-ae/ggupset 104 VPetukhov/ggrastr 102 gertstulp/ggplotgui 99 GuangchuangYu/ggimage 95 cosname/ggplot2-translation 92 kassambara/ggcorrplot 89 briatte/ggnetwork 88 xfim/ggmcmc 82","link":"/2020/01/22/R/R-gitgg/"},{"title":"R-riverplot","text":"pre { background-color:#38393d;

The result would be similar like Prim. If it is not, I’ll noted below. To be noticed, we should carefully select which protocol we use based on our data and purpose. For example, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, pairwise comparing based on the TukeyHSD test, control group pairwise comparing based on Dunnett Test, and finally, the repeat ANOVA test. As far as I know, we do not have a way to do ANOVA based on the summarized data set. However, we can simulate a table based on the summarized data and do the ANOVA test which could achieve the same result as the Prism, cheers!

It involves comparing the input gene set to a reference database, such as Gene Ontology, KEGG, or Reactome, and identifying the over-represented terms using statistical methods. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a type of enrichment analysis that determines whether a particular gene set shows statistically significant differences between two biological states. Unlike traditional enrichment analysis, GSEA considers the entire gene set, rather than individual genes, and evaluates whether the gene set is significantly enriched at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes based on their differential expression or correlation with a phenotype. GSEA is commonly used in transcriptomics and genomics studies to identify pathways or biological processes that are differentially regulated between disease and control samples. © ChatGPT Go ontology GO_1. Supported Organism For module species which added in OrgDb, we can turn the ID to GO_id; For other species, you can build your own OrgDb database by following GOSemSim. If genes are already annotated (in data.frame witch gene ID column followed by GO ID), we can use enricher() and geosGO() function to perform over-representation test. GO_2.

The weird thing is that everything works fine when I use the code in the terminal, but as soon as I write the code into a script, it just doesn’t seem to work. The author suggests that the issue could be resolved by updating to the latest version. However, this would mean that I would also need to update either the Bioconductor or R base. I don’t want to update anything, I just want the job to be done.

How to use different types of data with this function Due to some unpleasant reasons, the logic of this functions is kind of wired and jumping. Instead of insert more “wired” patches to confusing myself, I decided not rewrite this function but given more detailed descriptions and examples. Cheers! Tips 1: DO NOT CONTAIN “-” IN YOUR SAMPLE/GROUP NAMES, it would ruine the Tukey-test function. Tips 2: Assign all the character variables into factors. It would solve most of unpleasant errors.

Flexibility: ggplot is a very flexible and customizable plotting package that allows you to create high-quality, publication-ready plots with a high degree of control over the visual aesthetics of your plots. You can easily modify various aspects of the plot, such as the color, shape, and size of the nodes and edges, and the placement of the labels. Integration with igraph: ggplot works seamlessly with igraph, making it easy to create complex and informative visualizations of your network data. You can use ggplot to visualize network data in a variety of ways, including heatmaps, scatterplots, and bar charts. Consistency: ggplot provides a consistent grammar for building plots, which makes it easy to create plots with a consistent style and look across different datasets. This can be particularly useful if you are working with multiple datasets and want to create a consistent visual language for your plots. Reproducibility: ggplot produces code that can be easily reproduced, making it easier to share and collaborate on your work. You can also easily modify and update your plots as your data or analysis changes. Overall, using ggplot to plot igraph results can help you create informative, visually appealing, and reproducible visualizations of your network data.

One is using ggplot2. The functions geom_smooth could help you finish it very elegantly. Another way is to follow the steps from rpubs which calculate it by yourself.

The threshold of the interval is 0.95 which could be changed in level = library(ggplot2)data(&quot;cars&quot;)ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point(color='#2980B9', size = 4) + geom_smooth(method=lm, color='salmon', fill= &quot;#ffa4a3&quot;, level = 0.95)+ theme_bw() Calculating confidence interval by yourself: Points from upper and lower side would be calculated and stored. reg.conf.intervals &lt;- function(x, y, CI=0.975) { n &lt;- length(y) # Find length of y to use as sample size lm.model &lt;- lm(y ~ x) # Fit linear model # Extract fitted coefficients from model object b0 &lt;- lm.model$coefficients[1] b1 &lt;- lm.model$coefficients[2] # Find SSE and MSE sse &lt;- sum((y - lm.model$fitted.values)^2) mse &lt;- sse / (n - 2) t.val &lt;- qt(CI, n - 2) # Calculate critical t-value # Fit linear model with extracted coefficients x_new &lt;- 1:max(x) y.fit &lt;- b1 * x_new + b0 # Find the standard error of the regression line se &lt;- sqrt(sum((y - y.fit)^2) / (n - 2)) * sqrt(1 / n + (x - mean(x))^2 / sum((x - mean(x))^2)) # Fit a new linear model that extends past the given data points (for plotting) x_new2 &lt;- 1:max(x + 100) y.fit2 &lt;- b1 * x_new2 + b0 # Warnings of mismatched lengths are suppressed slope.upper &lt;- suppressWarnings(y.fit2 + t.val * se) slope.lower &lt;- suppressWarnings(y.fit2 - t.val * se) # Collect the computed confidence bands into a data.frame and name the colums bands &lt;- data.frame(cbind(slope.lower, slope.upper)) colnames(bands) &lt;- c('Lower Confidence Band', 'Upper Confidence Band') # Plot the fitted linear regression line and the computed confidence bands plot(x, y, cex = 1.75, pch = 21, bg = 'gray') lines(y.fit2, col = 'black', lwd = 2) lines(bands[1], col = 'steelblue', lty = 2, lwd = 2) lines(bands[2], col = 'steelblue', lty = 2, lwd = 2) return(bands)}conf.intervals &lt;- reg.conf.intervals(cars$speed, cars$dist)head(conf.intervals) Lower Confidence Band Upper Confidence Band 1 -33.350170 6.056798 2 -29.417761 9.989207 3 -21.327925 9.764188 4 -17.395516 13.696597 5 -12.154300 16.320197 6 -6.971285 19.002000 Quadratic Equation Standard Equation: $$ y=ax^2+bx+c $$ model_mpg1 &lt;- lm(formula = hwy ~ I(displ^2), data = mpg)model_mpg2 &lt;- lm(formula = hwy ~ I(displ^2) + displ, data = mpg) model_mpg1: Call: lm(formula = hwy ~ I(displ^2), data = mpg) Coefficients: (Intercept) I(displ^2) 29.324 -0.429 model_mpg2: Call: lm(formula = hwy ~ I(displ^2) + displ, data = mpg) Coefficients: (Intercept) I(displ^2) displ 49.245 1.095 -11.760 plot Formula1 &lt;- function(x){ model_mpg1$coefficients[2]*x^2 + model_mpg1$coefficients[1]}Formula2 &lt;- function(x){ model_mpg2$coefficients[2]*x^2 + model_mpg2$coefficients[3]*x +model_mpg2$coefficients[1]}ggplot() + geom_point(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy),color='salmon') + theme_light()+ # regression model geom_line(aes(x=x,y=Formula1(x)))ggsave('')ggplot() + geom_point(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy),color='salmon') + theme_light()+ # regression model geom_line(aes(x=x,y=Formula2(x))) model_mpg1 model_mpg2 Formula $y=-0.429x^{2}+29.324$ $y=1.095x^{2} -11.760x + 49.245$ Plot cor cor() R2 谦瑞数据 2019 mylr = function(x,y){ x_mean = mean(x) y_mean = mean(y) xy_mean = mean(x*y) xx_mean = mean(x*x) yy_mean = mean(y*y) m = (x_mean*y_mean - xy_mean)/(x_mean^2 - xx_mean) b = y_mean - m*x_mean f = m*x+b# 线性回归方程 sst = sum((y-y_mean)^2) sse = sum((y-f)^2) ssr = sum((f-y_mean)^2) result = c(m,b,sst,sse,ssr) names(result) = c('m','b','sst','sse','ssr') result['ssr']/result['sst']}x = c(60,34,12,34,71,28,96,34,42,37)y = c(301,169,47,178,365,126,491,157,202,184) 一元多次回归方程自动扫描 T test and P value: 数据挖掘运爷 Functions: Click to see mylr = function(x,y){ x_mean = mean(x) y_mean = mean(y) xy_mean = mean(x*y) xx_mean = mean(x*x) yy_mean = mean(y*y) m = (x_mean*y_mean - xy_mean)/(x_mean^2 - xx_mean) b = y_mean - m*x_mean f = m*x+b# 线性回归方程 sst = sum((y-y_mean)^2) sse = sum((y-f)^2) ssr = sum((f-y_mean)^2) result = c(m,b,sst,sse,ssr) names(result) = c('m','b','sst','sse','ssr') result['ssr']/result['sst']}F_equation &lt;- function(X,Formula){ eval(parse(text = Formula))}LMEE &lt;- function(TB,Times){ colnames(TB)=c(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) Group_X = &quot;X&quot;

Basically, the size of the word has connected to the frequency of the word. The color was randomly assigned for giving a clear boundary for each word. It could be used as a graphic abstract of a single paper, or present the recent frequent-talked topics in a shocking way. In R, we can use split the words by space. But for other languages like Chinese, we can use library jiebaR to do the segmentation. In English, we’d also clean the results by deleting some “none-sense” words like “am”, “is”, and “are”.

Main structure of the Latex here is the structure of the latex projects: . ├── figures │ └── example_figure.pdf ├── ldr-article.cls ├── main.bib ├── main.pdf ├── main.tex ├── README.md └── Rmarkdown.Rmd This directory is an example from the overleaf (ldr-template). The figures is a directory for storing the figures. The ldr-article.cls is for storing all configures which like cs for html. the main.bib is for storing the citations the main.tex is the place for your main contented. \\documentclass{ldr-article}\\addbibresource{main.bib}\\title{Titiel is here }\\author{Karobben 1\\\\\\\\Karobben 2}\\begin{document} \\maketitle \\begin{abstract} There are no abstracts.

The different between two of them are parencite could automatically add parent symbol, “()”, for you.

If you need to use these characters as they are, you need to escape them using a backslash (\\). The special characters are: # $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \\. For example, if you want to write 5%, you need to write it as 5\\% in LaTeX. Inserting images: The graphicx package provides commands to work with images. You can use the \\includegraphics command to insert an image. \\usepackage{graphicx}\\begin{document}\\includegraphics{filename}\\end{document} Creating tables: The tabular environment can be used to create tables \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hlineHeader 1 &amp; Header 2 \\\\\\hlineRow 1, Col 1 &amp; Row 1, Col 2 \\\\Row 2, Col 1 &amp; Row 2, Col 2 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular} Dealing with large documents: For large documents like a thesis or a book, you can use \\input{filename} or \\include{filename} to add contents from another file. This can help keep your project organized. Math mode: LaTeX is widely used for its superior handling of mathematical equations. You can insert an inline mathematical equation like this: $E=mc^2$, or a standalone one like this: \\begin{equation}E=mc^2\\end{equation} Hyperlinks: With the hyperref package, you can add hyperlinks to your document. \\usepackage{hyperref}...\\href{https://www.example.com}{Link text} Referencing: With LaTeX, you can easily cross-reference figures, tables, sections, etc. For example, when you label a figure using \\label{fig:my_label} you can reference it with \\ref{fig:my_label} and it will automatically update the figure number. Remember, the power of LaTeX comes from the various packages available. When you want to do something specific, there is probably a package that can help you achieve it. Check the documentation of the packages to make full use of their features. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2020/08/25/Blog/Latex/"},{"title":"Kivy in Action 1: Problem in Urlrequest","text":"Kivy in Action: A Sample Crawler My coworker asked me for help checking the database (A web server) very frequently since without a USB-key, there is no way to log in to the database, and most of the time, she is not in the company. But luckily, I find there is almost no obstacle on the way you crawling it by using python except the cookie is updated every day. So, I decided to write an android app for her so she can check the results on her own. And I just need to send her the cookie if it is updated. It’ll really save my day! Borrow the Codes I’m kind of a new bee in kivy. So, instead of writing on my own, I decided to copy the may frame from the book “Creating Apps in Kivy: Mobile with Python”. It is an awesome book. It’ll introduce kivy to you by teaching you how to build a weather app. It is really helpful for the new bee like me. For the first few chapters, everybody can understand it very quickly and easily as if you know execute print(hello world) in python. Then, it’ll imply lots of class which I can’t understand back that time I first read it. And due to the update of python and some typographical errors, you need to know how to correct it. The main code is in Light Weather App. You can customize the codes of function search_location(self) and found_location(self, request, data) to access what you like. I insert my codes and everything works fine on the computer. But some strange things happened after I run it on my cell phone. The result pops up, it means the codes works fine.

It is fun to see the changing of the plants in the tank after combined the pictures. But the problem is their are few blurt images in those hundreds of pictures. So, I wonder it is really cool that detect the blurt pictures by using python. So, I found two posts from internet and try to find the suitable one for me. Two reference posts: 技术挖掘者; 2019 Dontla; 2019 So, there have 574 photos in total and I have no idea which one is blurt images. 技术挖掘者 Blurt Clear Dontla Blurt Clear Compare By comparing the result of those to codes, I found that they used the exact same way: cv2.Laplacian to calculate… I should really check the raw codes before executing them. First Second The simplified codes should be: import cv2imagePath = &quot;img.png&quot;image = cv2.imread(imagePath)## 将图片转换为灰度图片gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)## 计算灰度图片的方差fm = cv2.Laplacian(gray, cv2.CV_64F).var()print(fm) 很不实用 = = 真的单独一个算法来这么检测, 太水了.

There’s been a lot of episodes before I finish it. But whatever, the result is good, I passed the exam. But what made me writing is nothing about the license, it’s something connected to my academic career, and it’ll definitely affect me in the future. I was writing a paper with my ex-teacher who is a very kind and tolerant person and focusing on Aquatics. If it is accepted, it’ll be my first paper in my academic career. As you can see, how significant it is for me. We agreed on most parts of the paper except one, which I devoted lots of time and energy to and felt very satisfied with it. As a result, I lost myself and believe that I must be right about it and this part would be the shiniest section of the whole paper. So, instead of deleting them, I asked one more time for perfecting this section and hoped that maybe she would concede my idea after I polished it. So, I started to google and read more papers to find evidence to strengthen my hypothesis. After about a half-hour, I looked back at my data and just realized that I dug it too deep to find the way home. It reminded me of common scenes in WuXia World that someone who gained the secret scroll which records the best KunFu in the world. But because it was the best, it was the hardest, too. It takes time to accept and digest them before they can really muster it. But they were desperate to muster it in a short time. So, they can not learn it well and result in hurting themselves or even becoming mad. As for me, I just believed that I was pretty close to doing something like that, too. Bioinformatics is a very powerful skill that I’d like to learn. It’s not hard to follow the pipeline, but it’s hard to make your own pipe to match your data. Though the connection of genes was revealed well according to cited papers, the expression changes and limited morphology data indicate that the relationships in this experiment were way complicated than I believed. So, I quickly re-adjusted myself and conceded my mistake. Luckily, she was so patient with me rather than directly against and denying me. Because if she did that and it definitely evokes my reverse. Then, I’ll dig the hole far deeper than this time and stack myself in it. I’m lucky at this time. But I may not have the same fortunes every time. So, I need to keep wise and clear to avoid this. Hoping it’ll never happen again.","link":"/2020/06/22/Blog/Post_1/"},{"title":"Python|OpenCV| Images to Video","text":"This is a script for connect a serious of images to a video by using python openCV.

The experiment is not hard for me. But the head-breaking part is analyzing the results for a freshman: there are so many! Traditionally, we can use Sequencing Analyzing to view the signal of electrophics. But there are 96 wells for each plate, and we have several plates in each day. It is hard to imagine checking the graphics one by one especially we have work to do. For solving this problem, I tried R and python both. But ggplot2 is just fucking slow for massive data (As we know, for each plate, there are 96 wells. Each well has 4 signal tunnels, and each tunnel contains about 17,000 check-point. As a result, there are about 6.5 million points to plot). It takes about 2 mins for R to collect all matrix, plot, and save it. But python works much fluently. Let’s see an example of the plot. Familiar with Your Data As we can see the result below, we have few types of pattern judged by the naked eyes: A01: Triangle. (The signal is decreasing but is still readable) A02: Flat. (Which doesn’t have signal at all) A08: Laying-Trapezoid. (The perfect result we’d love to) F01~F07: Acute Triangle. (Which means the signal is decreasing and the result is unreadable) C02: Stick. (Short sequence or Signal-Break due to some reasons.) Though, it is easy to acquire a model from ML by putting all those check-point into a matrix and training them. But I decided to reduce the burden of my computer. By first, I’d like to try something like linear regression. Linear Regression First, Let’s take a quick look of the smooth line Now, let’s try the linear regression. Main codes can be found at my blog Let’s take the well H12 as an example By using geom_smooth from ggplot2, we can achieve these graphics easily. By calculating the regression function by lm with the exponent from 1 to 13, we can get the result as below An example of regression function: $$ f(x)= -5.33506521414874 e^{-56} * x^{13}+2.33068989275763 e^{-50} * x^{12} $$ $$ -4.44202743547308 e^{-45} * x^{11}+4.8269078976017 e^{-40} * x^{10} $$ $$ -3.27011035492282 e^{-35} * x^9+1.40852725678933 e^{-30} * x^8 $$ $$ -3.68400537011035 e^{-26} * x^7+4.64218496851634 e^{-22} * x^6 $$ $$ +2.12911181720032 e^{-18} * x^5-1.64587230405762 e^{-13} * x^4 $$ $$ +2.2678114895877 e^{-09} * x^3-1.27776012720345 e^{-05} * x^2 $$ $$ +0.0270106008326289 * x^1 -8.24054735022609 $$ As we can see, the last diagram is almost about the same as the result of geom_smooth! Another awesome thing is it takes only a second to get the result!!

I was tried to use 0 and 1 to replace the result of failed and success and running: xgboost(data = dtrain, max.depth = 2, eta = 1, nthread = 2, nrounds = 2, objective = &quot;binary:logistic&quot;) It works. Not perfect, but acceptable. Because I was trying to find a way to call bases from the raw abi file and failed, I using the Sequencing Analyzing software to made a post processing to get the sequence and quality grades of the bases. Once we have the quality matrix, we can have a better way to grade the result. My choice is calculating the mean value of the base-quality from 80 to 120 for several reasons: 120 base is enough to value a successful task. first 80 bases have low quality and usually was tossed. I’d like to collect the result though it’s a derogation-signal. I choose R to achieve this because package sangerseqR can turn the quality grades to integer from bin16 format. And I don’t know how to achieve this in Python.

Though, 5 rounds is not enough (fails ratio &gt; 4%), I don’t want the model be over fitted. Since the training data is better than before, I get the best performance for ever.","link":"/2020/09/13/Blog/R_abi_re/"},{"title":"Urwid B站 up主信息实时显示的TUI应用 updating...","text":"Urwid B站 up主信息实时显示的TUI应用 updating… import urwid, time, sys, ast, requests, jsonfrom urllib.request import urlopenclass BiliSpider: def __init__(self): self.online_api = &quot;https://api.bilibili.com/x/web-interface/online&quot;

Give a brief statement about my situation: I just quit my job and staying with my parents. I am waiting for Autumn fall to come back to campus. I am writing a paper for my previous mentor for publishing. I am trying to update my blogs every day. I am learning python and kivy every day. I also plan to learn some statistics and bioinformatics. I still didn’t finish my reading task. I want to do some biochemistry knowledge review. I also want to learn more complicated vocabulary and native idioms. I also want to play switch games. I worry that I can’t pass the driver’s license check the day after postnatal. I am worried about I can’t get the visa two months from now. I am worried that I can’t pass my classes one year from now. I am worried about I can’t graduate from campus three years from now. And also, I am pushing my progress very slow, as slow as a snail. That’s why I am falling into deep anxiety and depression. It has given me so much pressure and worried about so many things. Also, I have no peers around, no much of face to face communication. Though, I have lots of friends living in the same city as me. But I don’t want to call them, bather them. And I also lack exercise… coffee addiction, low appetite, small eater, sedentary life-style, trouble with fall into sleep, can’t get up earlier. All those things make me feel like I am a loser. I think I need a plan to tightly stick with it. I also need to set times to take a break since I never know how to stop once I start typing. I’ll start with going to sleep and waking up on time first.

I really need a calendar to stick on the wall and remind me again and again. I considered some online services like outlook calendar or google calendar but they are not fancy. I think it could be cool that I can show it in the terminal, for one thing, is that I can make the background dark to save the bower. On the other hand, I can use the old tablet or android phone to display the calendar for a whole day in the “termux”. It could also be my small server for running some programs. According to some posts, it can also sync your online calendars like google calendar or outlook calendar. I tried to use vdirsyncer to synchronize the Google calendar but failed. I applied the Client ID but it tell me that I had uri_redirect_mistake. Annoying. But anyway, I still like to use it in local, synchronize them through the local network with some stupid bash scrip.

But it still doen’t work at first. Thanks for BoyInTheSun[4]. It seams like it conflicted to lived2d plugin. By solving this problem, the best solution is download the script to local and alter the script. Before you do this, make sure you have called the busuanzi: false in _congig.icarus.yml or it won’t work. Insert latest script inner the &lt;div class=&quot;level-start&quot;&gt; tags at /themes/icarus/layout/common/footer.ejs file The latest script you can find at BUSUANZI /themes/icarus/layout/common/footer.jsx&lt;script async src=&quot;//busuanzi.ibruce.info/busuanzi/2.3/busuanzi.pure.mini.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_container_site_pv&quot;&gt;本站总访问量&lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_value_site_pv&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;次&lt;/span&gt; Go check the raw codes. if it shows that &lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_container_site_uv&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt; and nothing show at all, it means some plugin conflicted to it. You can fix this by following another post. Visitors for each post[5] This script is based on the Busaunzi script below After you insert the codes below appropriately, we can add the codes below inner &lt;div class=&quot;level-left&quot;&gt; in /themes/icarus/layout/common/article.jsx /themes/icarus/layout/common/article.jsx{/* counts of this passage*/}&lt;i class=&quot;far fa-eye&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_container_page_pv&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;busuanzi_value_page_pv&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;{/* counts of this passage Done*/} Copyright announcement for Cover image[6] Result: add a covercopy tag in the md header ***.mdtitle: &quot;Hexo theme: icarus&quot;date: &quot;2021/02/11&quot;toc: truecovercopy: '© ppoffice' Then, insert the codes below in card-image tag in themes/icarus/layout/common/article.jsx file as it’s show. &lt;span style=&quot;position: absolute; bottom: 0; right: 0; padding-right:3px; padding-left:4px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)&quot; class=&quot;ccopy&quot; dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: index &amp;&amp; page.covercopy ? page.covercopy : page.covercopy }}&gt;&lt;/span&gt; My example: article.jsx{cover ? &lt;div class=&quot;card-image&quot;&gt; {index ? &lt;a href={url_for(page.link || page.path)} class=&quot;image is-7by3&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;fill&quot; src={cover} alt={page.title || cover} /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;image is-7by3&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;fill&quot; src={cover} alt={page.title || cover} /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span style=&quot;position: absolute; bottom: 0; right: 0; padding-right:3px; padding-left:4px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)&quot; class=&quot;ccopy&quot; dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: index &amp;&amp; page.covercopy ? page.covercopy : page.covercopy }}&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; : null} 和瓦雀共存 瓦雀需要summary.md做index界面, 需要(可選) layout.md 做統一落款, 用 yuque.yml 做配置文件 如果直接使用, 則會出現如下圖片情況: 這些文件都會被渲染且置頂(因爲沒有時間). 非常難受. 查閱後可知, hexo 自帶的 skip_render 可以完美解決此方案. 因此, 只需要在_config.yml 中, 添加通配字符, 即可解決次問題. _config.ymlskip_render: - _posts/**/**.yml - _posts/**/layout.md - _posts/**/summary.md - _posts/**/index.md 之後, 記得 清除緩存, 再查看效果 hexo cleanhexo s --watch 用 python 腳本輔助更新語雀筆記: 腳本鏈接 Change the Size of the Logo The size of the default logo was too small to fit the cell phone page. So, I tried to alter the height from the raw code. But nothing happened. By retrieving the element one by one, you’ll finally find that it sited an argument of max-height: 1.75rem for this class. The quick solution is to set a new value for max-height in themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl.(PS: I set it equals 3.8rem) Bsides, I also commented the padding and margin to make the header tight. themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl.navbar-item display: flex align-items: center /*padding: $navbar-item-padding-v $navbar-item-padding-h*/ /*margin: $navbar-item-margin-v $navbar-item-margin-h*/ © KarobbenBefore © KarobbenAfter © KarobbenThe Final And this how I find everything. By checking the raw codes, we can know the logo was: &lt;a class=&quot;navbar-item navbar-logo&quot; href=&quot;/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/Karobben_logo_horizontal_800.png&quot; alt=&quot;Karobben&quot; height=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The class is navbar-logo. So, by searching this class, we can located it in grep -s &quot;navbar-logo&quot; $(find themes/icarus)| awk -F&quot;:&quot; '{print $1}' themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl themes/icarus/layout/common/navbar.jsx By checking the themes/icarus/layout/common/navbar.jsx, there are nothing we can do. &lt;a class=&quot;navbar-item navbar-logo&quot; href={siteUrl}&gt; {navbarLogo}&lt;/a&gt; By checking the themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl, we now know, .navbar-logo img max-height: $logo-height Let’s continue to retrive the logo-height grep -s &quot;logo-height&quot; $(find themes/icarus)| awk -F&quot;:&quot; '{print $1}' themes/icarus/include/style/base.styl themes/icarus/include/style/footer.styl themes/icarus/include/style/navbar.styl Finally, you’ll find this in themes/icarus/include/style/base.styl: $logo-height ?= 1.75rem Stick the togs (headers/CATALOGUE) In version V4.0, the scripts in themes/icarus/layout/widget are all gone except profile.jsx. I have no idea why. But by reading the issue #740, I thought maybe I can try to bring it back to the widget. When I firstly copy toc.jsx from hexo-component-inferno, it runs incorrectly: ERROR { err: Error: Cannot find module '../../util/cache' Require stack: - /media/ken/Data/Github/hexo-icarus/themes/icarus/layout/widget/toc.jsx - /media/ken/Data/Github/hexo-icarus/node_modules/hexo-renderer-inferno/lib/compile.js - /media/ken/Data/Github/hexo-icarus/node_modules/hexo-renderer-inferno/index.js at Function.Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:923:15) Obviously, we lack a model named cache.js So, I checked the repository again and found the util/cache.js at here Instead of making another directory, I placed the cache.js to themes/icarus/scripts/cache.js and change the path in themes/icarus/layout/widget/toc.jsx Here’s how I achieved it: copy the cache.js from GitHub to themes/icarus/scripts/cache.js copy the toc.jsx from GitHub to themes/icarus/layout/widget/toc.jsx Replace the codes: toc.jsx- const { cacheComponent } = require('../../until/cache');+ const { cacheComponent } = require('../../scripts/cache'); Adding the is-sticky in to the class[7]: toc.jsx- &lt;div class=&quot;card widget&quot; id=&quot;toc&quot; data-type=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;+ &lt;div class=&quot;card widget is-sticky&quot; id=&quot;toc&quot; data-type=&quot;toc&quot;&gt; BASHhexo cleanhexo g Change the “latest posts” to “Recommended Post” One of the sidebars is showing the latest posts. But, yeah, it is unnecessary since everything shows on the home page already. But it’ll be a good place to place your most recommended or valuable posts. By doing that, we need to make a few changes. For old version[8]: Find \\icarus\\layout\\widget\\recent_posts.ejs: Change the code 1 to code 2 ejs recent_posts.ejs- &lt;% site.posts.sort('date', -1).limit(5).each(post =&gt; { %&gt;+ &lt;% site.posts.sort('priority', -1).limit(5).each(post =&gt; { %&gt; Change the name of the block: Change the name in language is fine en.yml- recents: 'Recents'+ recents: 'Recommend' Adding the priority at the head of the posts. post.md---title: &quot;Hexo theme: icarus&quot;date: &quot;2021/02/11&quot;toc: true+ priority: 1--- For Version 4.0 As is the situation in above, we need to cp the files, first. copy the article_media.jsx from GitHub to layout/common/article_media.jsx copy the recent_posts.jsx GitHub to themes/icarus/layout/widget/recent_posts.jsx Alter the require path: recent_posts.jsx- const { cacheComponent } = require('../../until/cache');+ const { cacheComponent } = require('../../scripts/cache'); Alter the codes similar like the old version: recent_posts.jsx- .sort('date', -1)+ .sort('priority') Adding priority as same as above: post.md---title: &quot;Hexo theme: icarus&quot;date: &quot;2021/02/11&quot;toc: true+ priority: 1--- Attention: It might not work if you didn’t add priority to most of the posts and this takes me a few hours to found it out… You can use sed to add the priority to all posts: sed -i '/^thumbnail:/a\\priority: 10000' $(find source/_posts/ -name &quot;*.md&quot;) Make sure that the ^thumbnail: is unique to each post. hexo cleanhexo g Keep _post directory free with suspicious files Highlight/Mark In markdown, we can using the == to mark words or sentences. But the the default mark would be rendering to yellow: Highlight And my target is change it to Highlight Open include/style/article.styl: article.stylh5 font-size: 1em+ mark+ background-color: salmon+ padding: .2em+ border-radius: .4em BASHhexo cleanhexo g max height for &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; The passage would be looked untidy if the code block or the &lt;pre&gt; block is too long. So, assign the max-height is a good choise. Since code was embedded in pre, we just need to change pre.

In this blog post, we’ll delve into why sparse datasets can cause poor performance in some machine learning algorithms, explore solutions to overcome these challenges, and provide code snippets for a hands-on understanding. Understanding Sparse Datasets Sparse datasets are characterized by having a large proportion of missing or zero values. This sparsity can result from various scenarios, such as user-item interactions in recommendation systems or word occurrences in text data. While handling sparse data can be intricate, understanding its challenges is the first step towards crafting efficient solutions. import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Example of a sparse matrixnum_rows = 100num_cols = 100# Define the density of the sparse matrix# Density is the proportion of non-zero elements in the matrixdensity = 0.05# Generate a random sparse matrixsparse_matrix = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(num_rows, num_cols), p=[1-density, density])# Visualizing the sparse matrixplt.spy(sparse_matrix, marker='.', color='salmon')plt.title('Visualization of a Sparse Matrix')plt.show() Challenges Posed by Sparse Datasets Insufficient Information: Learning meaningful patterns becomes difficult due to the scarcity of non-zero values. High Dimensionality: The curse of dimensionality can affect distance-based algorithms by distorting the meaningfulness of distances between data points. Overfitting: The model might capture noise as patterns, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data. Computational Inefficiency: Some algorithms struggle with processing high-dimensional sparse data efficiently. Imbalance: Sparse datasets might introduce class imbalance, leading to biased models. Feature Importance: Determining which features are informative is challenging in sparse scenarios. Distance Measures: For algorithms that rely on distance measures, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM), sparse datasets can distort distances between data points, making it difficult to find similarities and differences. Strategies to Overcome the Challenges Dimensionality Reduction PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can help in reducing the feature space while retaining the most important information. from sklearn.decomposition import PCA# Initializing PCA and fitting on the sparse datapca = PCA(n_components=2)reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(sparse_matrix)# Visualizing the reduced dataplt.scatter(reduced_data[:, 0], reduced_data[:, 1], marker='o', color='b')plt.title('Visualization of Reduced Data')plt.show() Imputation Filling missing values based on certain strategies, such as mean imputation, can mitigate the impact of sparsity. from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer# Initializing the imputer and performing imputationimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(sparse_matrix) Feature Selection Retaining only the most informative features can lead to improved model robustness. from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2# Define target_variable for the sake of example# It could be any array of labels corresponding to each data point (row) in your sparse_matrix# For instance, it can be created as follows (assuming a classification task with two classes, 0 and 1):target_variable = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(num_rows,), p=[0.5, 0.5])# Initializing feature selection method and selecting the best featuresselector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=2)selected_data = selector.fit_transform(sparse_matrix, target_variable) The target_variable is the dependent variable we are trying to predict in a supervised learning task. In the context of the code snippet, it should be the label or the output corresponding to each data point (row) in your sparse_matrix. In this example, target_variable is generated randomly, assuming a binary classification task. In a real-world scenario, target_variable would contain the actual labels of your data points. For each row in your sparse_matrix, there should be a corresponding label in target_variable. Regularization L1 and L2 regularization can prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso# Initializing Lasso with L1 regularizationlasso_model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)lasso_model.fit(features, target_variable) Ensemble Methods Random Forests, an ensemble method, can aid in improving generalization and managing overfitting. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier# Initializing and training a RandomForest Classifierrf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)rf_model.fit(features, target_variable) Conclusion While sparse datasets pose several challenges in machine learning, ranging from high dimensionality to overfitting, a variety of strategies and techniques exist to navigate these issues. By adopting appropriate methods such as dimensionality reduction, imputation, and regularization, we can harness the potential of sparse data and build effective and robust machine learning models. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/09/27/Python/sparse-datasets/"},{"title":"Diving Into Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis: A Beginner’s Guide","text":"Welcome to the fascinating world of single-cell RNA-Seq analysis! If you’re a budding scientist, curious learner, or someone looking to understand the intricacies of cellular biology, you’re in for a treat. This guide is tailored for newbies and aims to make the complex world of single-cell RNA-Seq analysis approachable and intriguing. What is Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis? © rebuildingakidney.org RNA-Seq stands for RNA sequencing, a revolutionary technique that helps scientists understand the expression of genes within a cell. In traditional RNA-Seq, we study the averaged gene expression of thousands of cells, but this approach has its limitations. It’s like trying to understand the flavor profile of a smoothie by tasting it – you know the overall taste, but you can’t pinpoint the individual fruits that contribute to it. This is where Single-Cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis steps in! It allows scientists to examine the gene expression at the individual cell level, unraveling the unique role and state of each cell, akin to tasting each fruit separately! Why Should You Learn It? 1. Unveiling Cellular Diversity: scRNA-Seq analysis reveals the immense diversity and specialization of cells in an organism, helping us understand how different cells contribute to the function and development of tissues and organs. 2. Disease Understanding &amp; Treatment: It plays a crucial role in understanding various diseases at the cellular level, thereby aiding in the development of targeted treatments and personalized medicine. 3. Cutting-Edge Research: By learning scRNA-Seq analysis, you’re diving into a field at the forefront of biological and medical research, opening doors to various career and research opportunities. How to Learn Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis 1. Online Courses &amp; Tutorials: Many platforms offer specialized courses in scRNA-Seq analysis. Websites like Coursera, edX, and LinkedIn Learning host beginner-friendly courses to help you understand the basics and get hands-on experience. 2. Workshops &amp; Seminars: Keep an eye out for workshops, webinars, and seminars conducted by universities, research institutions, and organizations. These events often provide insights into the latest developments and practical applications of scRNA-Seq analysis. 3. Research Papers &amp; Journals: Scientific journals and publications are treasure troves of information. Websites like PubMed and Google Scholar can be your go-to resources for the latest research papers on scRNA-Seq analysis. 4. Join Online Communities: Platforms like Reddit, Stack Overflow, and Biostars have dedicated forums for scRNA-Seq where you can ask questions, share knowledge, and connect with other learners and experts. 5. Practical Experience: Nothing beats hands-on experience! Use publicly available datasets to practice and apply what you’ve learned. Websites like NCBI’s GEO or EMBL-EBI’s ArrayExpress are great places to find datasets. 6. Coding Skills: Familiarity with programming languages like R and Python can be extremely beneficial. If you’re new to coding, consider taking introductory courses available on Codecademy, Kaggle, or DataCamp. Integration Analysis The FindTransferAnchors() and TransferData() functions were introduced in Seurat v3. Seurat v3 was a significant release that incorporated many new methods, especially for the integration and alignment of multiple datasets. Before Seurat v3, data integration and label transfer were more cumbersome and less streamlined. If you’re using an older version of Seurat and want to leverage these functions, you should consider upgrading to at least Seurat v3 or the latest available version. Always refer to the official Seurat documentation and changelogs for detailed information about function availability and updates across different versions. Integrating scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq data is one of the powerful applications of FindTransferAnchors() and TransferData() in Seurat v3 and later. Despite being two distinct types of sequencing data – one capturing gene expression (scRNA-Seq) and the other capturing chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq) – the underlying assumption is that similar cell types/states in both datasets should have correlated patterns in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Here’s how it generally works: Representation in a Shared Space: Before finding anchors, both scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq data are transformed into a lower-dimensional space (like PCA space). For scRNA-Seq, this is straightforward. For scATAC-Seq, peak (or gene activity) scores can be used, which summarize the chromatin accessibility signals into a gene-centric score. Finding Anchors: FindTransferAnchors() is then used to find anchors between the datasets. Despite the data’s different origins, the method identifies mutual nearest neighbors in the shared reduced-dimensional space. Data Transfer: Once anchors are identified, TransferData() can be used to transfer labels (like cell type annotations) from scRNA-Seq data to scATAC-Seq data or vice versa. This transfer can also be used to infer gene activity scores in scATAC-Seq data based on scRNA-Seq data. Integrative Analysis: After the data transfer, one can perform joint analyses on the two datasets, leveraging the strengths of both data types. For instance, a certain cell type identified in scRNA-Seq data can be examined in scATAC-Seq data to understand the regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters) that might be driving its gene expression patterns. A few things to note: The integration doesn’t mean that the two datasets are forced to look identical. Instead, the goal is to identify and leverage the shared structure between them. Appropriate preprocessing is crucial. For scATAC-Seq, one typically uses a “gene activity matrix”, which provides an estimation of gene activity based on nearby chromatin accessibility. This integration can be powerful, but like all methods, it requires careful interpretation and validation. The Seurat team has provided vignettes and tutorials on this topic, demonstrating how to integrate scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq data using their toolkit. If you’re planning to apply this to your data, it’s a good idea to refer to their official resources for step-by-step guidance. Final Thoughts Diving into single-cell RNA-Seq analysis can seem daunting initially, but remember, every expert was once a beginner. Be patient, stay curious, and don’t hesitate to ask questions. The journey might be challenging, but the rewards, insights, and knowledge you’ll gain along the way are incredibly fulfilling.

These are technical non-biological variations that arise when samples are processed in separate runs or under slightly different conditions. If not accounted for, batch effects can overshadow true biological differences, leading to misinterpretations. Why Remove Batch Effects? Imagine studying the effects of a drug on cell populations, with samples processed both before and after treatment. If the ‘before’ samples were processed in one batch and the ‘after’ samples in another, any difference you observe might be due to this batch variation rather than the drug effect. Removing batch effects ensures that: Biological variations are distinguishable from technical variations. Combined data from multiple batches can be analyzed together without biases. Results are consistent, reproducible, and truly reflective of biological phenomena. Approaches to Counter Batch Effects Several methods have been developed to correct for batch effects. Here, we’ll delve into three popular methods used within the Seurat package: Harmony, fastMNN, and SCTransform. A Comparative Glimpse: Feature Harmony fastMNN (batchelor) SCTransform Method Operates in PCA space to adjust principal components. Uses Mutual Nearest Neighbors to align cells. Regresses out unwanted variation and stabilizes variance. Use Cases Integrating datasets from different conditions, protocols, or platforms. Integrating datasets with batch effects. Faster than original MNN. Alternative to traditional normalization in Seurat. Prepares data for analysis. Advantages Preserves biological structures well; robust to complex batch effects. Designed for scRNA-seq batch correction; faster than original MNN; corrects severe batch effects. Stabilizes variance; can handle large datasets efficiently. Disadvantages Can be computationally intensive with large datasets. Requires a good selection of mutual nearest neighbors. Not specifically a batch correction method; often combined with other methods. Deep Dive into the Methods: Harmony: Ideal for integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Harmony adjusts the principal components of the data such that inter-batch differences are minimized while retaining biological variation. fastMNN (from the batchelor package): This method identifies mutual nearest neighbors between batches, assuming that these pairs of cells represent the same cell type across batches. It’s an optimized and faster variant of the original MNN algorithm. SCTransform: More than a batch correction technique, SCTransform is a robust normalization method. It prepares the data for downstream analysis, including batch correction, by regressing out unwanted sources of variation. Final Thoughts: Batch effect correction is a crucial step in scRNA-seq data processing. By choosing the right method tailored to your dataset’s needs, you can unveil genuine biological insights without being misdirected by technical noises. Always visualize and interpret results at each step, ensuring that biological variation remains the highlight of your study. In Action Seurat offers several methods to correct for batch effects, ensuring that variations across batches don’t obscure the biological signals you’re interested in. Here’s a step-by-step guide to remove batch effects using Seurat: Install and Load Seurat: First, ensure you’ve installed and loaded the Seurat package. install.packages('Seurat')library(Seurat) Data Integration (Using Harmony, SCTransform, and others): Seurat offers various integration methods like Harmony, fastMNN, and SCTransform. Here, I’ll showcase using SCTransform followed by RunPCA and Harmony: # List of Seurat Objects from different batchesseurat_list &lt;- list(batch1_seurat, batch2_seurat, ...)# SCTransform normalizationseurat_list &lt;- lapply(seurat_list, function(x) { x &lt;- SCTransform(x, verbose = FALSE)})# Identify anchors for integrationanchors &lt;- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = seurat_list, normalization.method = &quot;SCT&quot;, anchor.features = 2000, verbose = FALSE)# Integrate dataintegrated_data &lt;- IntegrateData(anchorset = anchors, normalization.method = &quot;SCT&quot;, verbose = FALSE) If you prefer using Harmony specifically: library(harmony)integrated_data &lt;- RunPCA(integrated_data, features = VariableFeatures(object = integrated_data))integrated_data &lt;- RunHarmony(integrated_data, group.by.vars = &quot;batch&quot;) Scale and Run Linear Dimensional Reduction: integrated_data &lt;- ScaleData(integrated_data, verbose = FALSE)integrated_data &lt;- RunPCA(integrated_data, verbose = FALSE) Cluster and Visualize Integrated Data: Using UMAP or t-SNE to visualize the integrated data is a great way to confirm if the batch effects have been mitigated. integrated_data &lt;- RunUMAP(integrated_data, reduction = &quot;harmony&quot;, dims = 1:30)DimPlot(integrated_data, group.by = &quot;batch&quot;) Optional - Regression of unwanted sources of variation: If you are aware of specific unwanted sources of variation, you can regress them out using the vars.to.regress parameter in the ScaleData function. seurat_object &lt;- ScaleData(seurat_object, vars.to.regress = &quot;batch&quot;) Remember, the removal of batch effects should be done carefully. Overcorrection might lead to loss of genuine biological variation. It’s always a good practice to visualize and interpret the results at each step, ensuring the intended correction. Lastly, Seurat’s integration methods and their parameters might evolve with time, so always consult the latest Seurat documentation or vignettes to ensure you’re using the most effective and up-to-date approaches. Harmony, fastMNN, and SCTransform are all methods to handle batch effects and data normalization in single-cell RNA-seq data, but they operate based on different principles and have distinct purposes. In summary: Harmony and fastMNN are batch-correction methods that work to align datasets from different batches or conditions. SCTransform is a normalization method that prepares the data for further analysis, including batch correction. When dealing with batch effects, researchers often first normalize the data using SCTransform and then apply batch correction methods like Harmony or fastMNN to the transformed data. This two-step approach ensures that the data is both normalized and free of batch effects, making downstream analyses like clustering and differential expression more reliable.

However, integrating datasets, especially from different labs or experiments, can be challenging. In this guide, we’ll walk through the process of integrating scRNA-seq datasets using Seurat and provide tips for newcomers to the field. Why Integrate scRNA-Seq Data? Integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets allows researchers to compare or combine data from different experiments, conditions, or labs. This is crucial when aiming to: Combine datasets to increase sample size. Compare conditions across different experiments. Mitigate batch effects arising from different experimental conditions. The Seurat Integration Workflow Seurat, a popular R package for scRNA-seq data analysis, provides a robust framework for data integration. Here’s a step-by-step guide: Preprocessing Before integration, preprocess each dataset separately. This includes: Filtering cells. Normalizing data. Identifying variable features. library(Seurat)#DefaultAssay(seurat_obj1) &lt;- &quot;RNA&quot;#DefaultAssay(seurat_obj2) &lt;- &quot;RNA&quot;seurat_obj1 &lt;- NormalizeData(seurat_obj1)seurat_obj2 &lt;- NormalizeData(seurat_obj2)seurat_obj1 &lt;- FindVariableFeatures(seurat_obj1, selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;, nfeatures = 2000)seurat_obj2 &lt;- FindVariableFeatures(seurat_obj2, selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;, nfeatures = 2000) Performing log-normalization 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100% [----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----| **************************************************| Calculating gene variances 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100% [----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----| **************************************************| Calculating feature variances of standardized and clipped values 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100% [----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----| **************************************************| Why nfeatures = 2000 The nfeatures parameter, when set to 2000 in the context of Seurat functions like FindVariableFeatures, specifies that the function should identify the top 2,000 most variable genes in the dataset. These variable genes are often used in downstream analyses, such as PCA, because they capture significant biological and technical variability that can help differentiate cell populations. The choice of 2000 as the number of variable features is somewhat arbitrary but has become a common default in many scRNA-seq workflows. Here’s why: Historical Precedence: Early scRNA-seq datasets were smaller, and selecting the top 2,000 variable genes was found to be a good balance between computational efficiency and capturing meaningful biological variability. Computational Efficiency: Using a subset of genes (like the top 2,000 variable genes) instead of the entire transcriptome makes downstream computations (like PCA, clustering, and UMAP/t-SNE embedding) faster and more memory-efficient. Biological Relevance: Genes that are variably expressed across cells often represent key markers that can differentiate cell types or states. By focusing on these genes, one can often capture the major axes of variation in the data. However, it’s essential to understand that 2000 is not a magic number, and depending on the specific dataset and research question, a different number might be more appropriate. Here are some considerations: Dataset Size: For larger datasets with more cells, you might benefit from selecting more than 2,000 variable genes. Conversely, for smaller datasets, a smaller number might suffice. Biological Question: If you’re interested in subtle subpopulations or rare cell types, you might need to consider more genes to capture this granularity. Exploration: It’s often beneficial to experiment with different numbers of variable features to see how it impacts downstream analyses. For instance, you can try 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, etc., and observe how it affects clustering or the resolution of cell populations in UMAP/t-SNE plots. In summary, while nfeatures = 2000 is a commonly used default, it’s crucial to understand its implications and adjust it as needed based on the specifics of your dataset and research goals. The method 'vst' refers to “Variance Stabilizing Transformation.” In the context of Seurat and scRNA-seq data analysis, the VST method is used to identify highly variable genes across single cells. Here’s a brief overview of the VST method: Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST): Purpose: The main goal of VST is to stabilize the variance across the mean of the data. In the context of gene expression data, this means making the variance of gene expression values more consistent across different expression levels. Why It’s Important: In raw count data, the variance often increases with the mean. This means that highly expressed genes naturally have higher variability just due to the nature of the data. VST aims to correct for this, allowing for the identification of genes that are genuinely variable across cells, not just because of their expression level. How It Works: Without diving too deep into the math, VST uses a transformation that makes the variance of the data approximately constant across different mean values. This transformation is data-driven and is estimated from the data itself. Application in Seurat: In Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function, when the method is set to 'vst', the function will use the VST approach to identify genes that are highly variable after accounting for the relationship between variance and mean expression. Comparison to Other Methods: Another common method used in Seurat for identifying variable genes is 'mean.var.plot', which fits a loess curve to the relationship between variance and mean expression. The VST method is often more robust, especially for larger datasets, but it’s always a good idea to understand and consider the implications of the method you’re using. In summary, the VST method in Seurat is a way to identify highly variable genes in a manner that accounts for and corrects the relationship between variance and mean expression. This helps in pinpointing genes that are genuinely variable across cells, which can be crucial for downstream analyses like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Identify Anchors Seurat uses the concept of “anchors” to identify correspondences between cells in different datasets. These anchors are then used for data integration. # FindIntegrationAnchors is really time consuming.

Tips for Newbies in scRNA-Seq Integration For those new to scRNA-seq integration, here are some essential tips: Quality Control: Ensure thorough QC on each dataset before and after integration. Visual Inspection: Use UMAP/t-SNE plots and heatmaps to visually inspect your data. Parameter Tuning: Adjust parameters based on your specific datasets. Biological Validation: Validate your findings with external data or experimental validation. Computational Considerations: Ensure you have enough memory and computational resources. Documentation: Keep detailed notes and consider using tools like R Markdown. Stay Updated: The field of scRNA-seq is rapidly evolving. Stay updated with the latest methods and best practices. Seek Feedback: Discuss your results with colleagues or experts in the field. 4. Conclusion Integrating scRNA-seq datasets can be challenging, especially for newcomers. However, with the right tools, a systematic approach, and a focus on the underlying biology, it’s possible to derive meaningful insights from integrated datasets. As with all bioinformatics tasks, continuous learning and practice are key to mastering scRNA-seq data integration.

In R, one of the most popular packages for data visualization is ggplot2. Among its many functions, geom_point stands out as a fundamental tool for creating scatter plots. In this blog post, we’ll delve deep into the geom_point function, exploring its basic grammar and how to customize the appearance of points in your plots. Basic Grammar and Code Example The basic grammar of geom_point is straightforward. At its core, you need a dataset and aesthetic mappings. The x and y aesthetics are the most common mappings used with geom_point. Here’s a simple example: library(ggplot2)# Sample datadata &lt;- data.frame( x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))# Basic scatter plotggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() This code will produce a scatter plot with the x and y values from our sample data. Customizing Point Appearance Changing Point Color You can change the color of the points using the color argument inside the aes() function: ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=&quot;white&quot;)) + geom_point() If you want to color points based on a variable, you can do so by mapping that variable to the color aesthetic: data$group &lt;- sample(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 100, replace = TRUE)ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=group)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() Show the name of group on the center of scatter points data_group &lt;- aggregate(cbind(x, y) ~ group, data=data, FUN=median)ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y, color=group)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_label(data = data_group, aes( label = group)) Changing Point Size To change the size of the points, use the size argument: ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point(size=3) Changing Point Shape ggplot2 provides various shapes for points. You can change the shape using the shape argument: ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point(shape=17) Shapes are represented by numbers. For example, 16 is a solid circle, 17 is a triangle, and so on. You can explore the ?points documentation in R to see a list of available shapes. Conclusion The geom_point function in ggplot2 offers a flexible and powerful way to create scatter plots in R. With just a few lines of code, you can produce a basic plot, and with a few more tweaks, you can customize it to your liking. As you continue your data visualization journey, remember that the key is not just to make plots look good, but to make them convey the right information effectively. pre { background-color:#38393d; color: #5fd381; }","link":"/2023/10/04/R/geom-point/"},{"title":"scRNA-Seq: makers explore","text":"Seurat is a popular R package for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. If you’ve already processed your data and assigned cell identities (classes), then finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two different classes is a common next step. Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to identify DEGs between two cell types or classes using Seurat: Setup: First, make sure you have the Seurat library loaded. library(Seurat) Differential Expression: Use the FindMarkers function in Seurat to identify DEGs. You can specify the two groups you are interested in by setting the ident.1 and ident.2 parameters. For example, if you have two classes named “ClassA” and “ClassB”, you can identify DEGs between these two classes as follows: de_genes &lt;- FindMarkers(object = your_seurat_object, ident.1 = &quot;ClassA&quot;, ident.2 = &quot;ClassB&quot;, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25, group.by = &quot;Final_id&quot;) |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed=29s your_seurat_object is your Seurat object. min.pct is the minimum percentage of cells where the gene must be detected in either of the two groups. logfc.threshold is the minimum log-fold change threshold. group.by is the colname from metadata Inspect Results: The resulting de_genes data frame will contain differentially expressed genes between “ClassA” and “ClassB”. It will include columns for the average expression in each class, the percentage of cells expressing the gene in each class, the log fold-change, and the adjusted p-value (among other metrics). Filter Based on Significance: You might want to filter out genes based on a significance threshold, for instance, an adjusted p-value less than 0.05: significant_genes &lt;- de_genes[de_genes$p_val_adj &lt; 0.05, ] Visualize: You can also visualize the expression of significant genes across different classes using feature plots or violin plots in Seurat. Remember, the parameters like min.pct, logfc.threshold, and the p-value cutoff should be chosen based on your specific dataset and research questions. Adjust them as necessary to balance sensitivity and specificity.
