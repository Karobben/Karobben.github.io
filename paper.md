## Introduction

Fruit fly has a long history as the model organism. Thomas Hunt Morgan is one of the first scientists made major contribution on fruit fly experiments in 1900s and push this organisms on the stage of the genetics. Drosophila melanogaster (Dmel) which is one of most popular species among other fruit flies are widely used in genetic, longevity, development,  and behavior studies. The merits of Dmel is outstanding: low cost, rapid generation, lots of offspring, well defined phenotype corresponded genotype, short life span, and elegant genome and simplified but highly homology pathways. Those all advantages made Dmel be a ideal and in irreplacable experiment organism and also contributed lots of early Nobel Prize by Thomas Hunt Morgan[^Morgan_16] and Hermann Muller[^Muller_28].

Low maintains and elegant genome size could be found on other model organism like C. elegans. But Dmel share about 60% of homologous gene to human and 75% of them are responsible to human disease[^Ugur_B_16] which makes them be a popular model to study disease like Alzmass, Non-specific immunity, muscle development diseases, and even cancer. Especially for Dmel tumor, the number of studies are rise exponentially after 90s[^Mirzoyan_19].

Cancer hall marks: sustaining proliferative signaling, Evading grouwth suppressors, activating invasion and metastasis, enabliing replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and resisting cell death are well described majority of cancer types among human[^Hanahan_11]. Those hall mars could also be found on fly tumor models. *Srcib* mutate clone of Dmel laval developed tumor on the Wing-Disk and because of the sustaining proliferation, it could growth larger them its normal size and leading the laval death[^Ji_19_Disease]. *Scrib* along may cause some cell autophage, but with more over activate *Ras*, tumor could evade death and went to over proliferation[^Uhlirova_06]. Salivary gland tumor which induced by Notch also show the invasive property[^Jhappan_1992][^Yang_19]. Tumor in drosophila can not lost long because it would cause cachexia-like wasting and cause early death[^Figueroa_15]. By transplanting the tumor tissue in to the abdomen of the drosophila and passing them each week could shows that it could became eternal cells[^Jiang_18_NC]. Those funding conformed the similarity between human tumor and drosophila tumor and established the drosophila research on tumor initiation, devaluing, and finally cause cachexia and host death. 

Drosophila wing disc is a powerful tool to studied the well controlled differentiation and tumor initiation. With the elegant regulation of signal pathway like Hippo and Wnt, it can increase its size by thousand-fold in 5 days[^LeGoff_13]. Expression of dlg-IR could induce apoptosis and in an invasion-like pheno-type in wing disc. In in egr-/- clone, the cell death of wing disc is totally blocked[^Cordero_10]. Another well established research find that the lgl4 mutants could cause tumor initiation in the wing disc-tumor[^Agrawal_95]. Sun, et al., verified that Yki mutation could also lead wing disc tumor[^sun_2011]. Wts[^Pascual_17] mutation could also lead the wing disc tumor. 

Eye disk was first introduced in 1976[^Ready_76]. Hedgehog (Hh) signal pathway is very important to the development and differentiation of the eye[^Heberlein_95] and it could regulate some important gene through Notch signal pathway[^Fu_03_dev]. Delta (DL) is a transmembrane ligand of Notch receptor and its down stream effects could be regulated by Hg signal pathway[^Parks_95]. CCR4-NOT is a conserved subunit complex which regulates the expression of genes[^Collart_12] and plays a role of tumor suppressor because over express Dl and know down CCR4-Not together could create the drosophila eye tumor[^Vicente_18]. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins PRC1 (ph) is another gene which could regulate the gene expresssion[^Grossniklaus_14] and suppress the tumor growth in Drosophila by repression of Notch signal pathway[^Martinez_09]. As a result, ph nock down could induce the eye disk tumor[^Torres_18][^Loubiere_16] and could survive and become larger after transplantation into to the abdomen[^Jiang_18_NC].

Ras is a enzyme which could convert inosine monophosphate (IMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and as a result to alter the cell growth[^Nash_94]. scrib is a protein coding gene which plays an important role in cell polarity[^Bilder_00] and growth[^Albertson_03]. It could target hippo signaling pathway directly and effect the cell growh[^shen_21]. In the Eye disk and wing disc, over express activate Ras along form could not induce tumor. Mutate Ras along is enough to induce tumor on Dmel eye disk[^Külshammer]. Nock down scrib along could induce wing disc tumor[^Ji_19_Disease] but not eye disck tumor[^Atkins_16]. Over-express activated form od Ras and know out scrib together could cause more aggressive tumor in both eye disk and wing disc[^Atkins_16][^Külshammer][^Hodgson_16].


WNT signals are transduced to the canonical pathway for cell fate determination, and to the noncanonical pathway for control of cell movement and tissue polarity[^Logan_04].  Canonical WNT signals are transduced through Frizzled (FZD) family receptors and LRP5/LRP6 coreceptor to the β-catenin signaling cascade[^Bhanot_96]. With absence of wnt signal, Scaffold protein APC complex with others like AXIN, CKIα (casein kinase Iα) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) would form a degradation complex to promotes β-catenin degradation[^Price_2006]. In Noncanonical wnt signaling pathway, Dishevelled which also required in canonical signaling pathway could activate the JNK signaling pathway[^Boutros_98][^Majidinia_17]. P53 is one of the important oncogene which coordinates the action of the DNA repair system and the cell cycle checkpoint[^Karimian_16] which is important to the cancer cell fate. In the one hand, the p53 could mediate the degradation of β-catenin through E3 ubiquitin ligase[^Matsuzawa_01], on the other hand, canonical wnt signaling pathway could up regulate the expression of the ARF tumor suppressor protin and directly activate p53 to trigger p53 response[^Oren_02].


- Hippo in the downstream of JNK and Ras

Scrib^-^ could activate Hippo Signaling pathway to started tumor initiation but the cell would activate JNK signaling pathway to started apoptosis[^Chen_12]. Lots of research shows that mutate Ras along with scrib^-^ could rescue the Cell apoptosis by activated JNK signaling pathway[^Uhlirova_05][^Brumby_03]. On the other hand, JNK is also required for hippo activation-induced cell invasion and so, bsk^DN^ could effect the activities of hippo itself[^Ma_17].

## Martial and Method

### RNA-Seq General Processing

At the end of the year 2022, we found approximately 30 projects and downloaded a total of 32 tumor models, which included multiple tumor types in some projects, as well as 215 biological groups and 517 sample from NCBI. We download all data from NCBI by using sra-tools and removed DNA-Seq, CHIP-Seq, and single cell RNA-Seq data and cooperate with our unpublished RNA-Seq data to run the standard processing. We use fastp 0.22.0[^fastp] to do run the raw reads quality control. Adaptors and low quality bases from the ends of the reads or low quality read are auto trimmed by fastp with default parameters. Quality before and after auto-trim is estimated by samtools. After quality control, we align the reads into the genome dme6 with bowtie2[^botwie2] by following the instruction of Trinity-RNA seq[^trinity]. After alignment, we also use RSEM 1.2.31[^rsem] to count the reads and edger 3.36.0[^edgeR] for following differential expression genes (DES) calculation. We use threshold of P ≤ 0.001 and a log2 fold change of 2 for filtering the significant DEG. The following Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is using clusterProfiler 4.2[^clusterprofiler]. All results are kept.

### GESA clustering

After calcualated the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) from both KEGG pathway gene sets and GO term gene sets (KGOS), all results are compiled togother and the tranfered in to a sample-KGOS matrix. The missing value is filled by 0 becuase hirarchy cluster and Weighted CorrelationNetwork Analysis (WGCNA)[^WGCNA]. We choose use WGCNA to clustering the KGOS because it can not only clustering the KGOS with similar changing pattern, but also group reversed KGOS into one module will hierarchy did not aware the reversed patterns. After that, we manually seleceted the  module with DNA replication which more than 400 KGOS in total. We them checked the p-value of the KGOS for each samples and filteted the samples which most KGOS adjusted p values is nit significant and the KGOS which missing in most KGOS. After filtering, we had 231 KGOS and 34 reliable samples. And then, we listed all genes from those KOGS for doing the Network Analysis.

### Network Analysis

Physical connections is downloaded from string database[^string]. A total score below than 150 is filtered and rest of connections are kept for the furthe usage. Protine id is witched into gene id by using online tools from flybase. we selectes the genes only belong to the selected KGOS module as the main network. We then calculate the mean value of the fold change and filtered the genes which absolute value is smaller than 1.5 and the degree less than 1 from the main network to kept the key genes. 1250 genes and  29174 conncections is remained and qgraph[^qgraph] is applyed to calcualte the Fruchterman Reingold layout[^layout] of each noedes (genes). With the log2FC distribution characteristic, we grouped them into 2 groups, the mainly up regulated set on the righy and down regulated set on tje left. The boundary is detected by using Gaussian smoothing from python SciPy[^scipy] to smoothe the log2FC value and value 0 is used to cut the boundary for two groups. After that, potential hub gene from each group is determined by the rank of degrees and the cross-talking genes is manully determined by the reversed group connection preference: the gene connected to the number of genes from itself group is lesser than other group.

## Result

### Similarities Among Samples

Most samples from the quality of samples are well enough to be used. We used density plot to present the quality before and after auto-trim. More than 90% center of them are similar in the score of before and after (Fig. A). But a good quality of raw reads doesn't garenty a appropriate library. We found that some library for example, Saliver gland G17F and G17M have a very high ratio of unmapped read which indicate that most of the reads from this sample are incorrect reads, it may frome mistake opreation during sequencing because other libraries from the same batch are all good (Fig. B). Other samples from gut also have arround 50% of unmapped read could be resonable. Because gut sample could be easy contaiminated by probiotic. We also find raletive high mismatch rate in sample wing disc and eye disk sample. It may caused by novo-mutation but could also bring by complicate cross-background.

Summary the similarities and heterogenous between samples 

### DNA replication and autophayge correlated with each other

For establish the similarities of KGOS changing pattern among tumor samples and some  are similar, we selected to use WGCNA to do the NES matrix clustering. There is another clustering algorithem, CLEAN, which is desinged to cluster NES matrix but similar to hiearchy clustering method, it could only group positive related clustering but not negtive corrolation awearness[^CLEAN]. With the parametes ** to running 4039 KGOS (Fig. I), we detected ** number of modules and focused on the module which contains DNA replications (Fig. C). Futher hiearchy clustring result divide them samples based on those modules into 3 groups: group 1 has most postive NES, gorup 2 shows almost an reversed pattern from group1, group3 are more like a random distribution and most of NES have a non-significant q value. By comparing with gorup 1 and 2, we can find that there is a will reversed pattern between two sets. The set with most positve NES is related into DNA replication, repairing, and damage sencing. The set with most negtive NES are related to metabolism, lysosom, and autophayge. It shows some that there are some connections between DNA replication/damage and lysosome/autophagy. For further exploring and establishing the relationship between them, we are going to looking more detailes into the genes. 

For aquring more reliable data from reliable datas, we checked the relationship between q value and the NES. Most q values of KEGOS from samples are not signifcants. For avoid the negative effects bring by non-significant NES of KGOS and smaples. After filtering, we finally selected 231 KGOS and 34 samples based on the criteria mantioned in method (Fig. D). Coincindently, we find that the all remaining samples are belong to group 1. It can be explained by that among siginficant q value group, positive NES are larger than negtive NES(Fig. E). We then list then genes from all 231 KGOS and calculate the mean value of log2FC among those 34 samples which are all belong to group 1. By this step, we got 4155 genes in the list. For further reduce redundent genes, we deleted low expression changing genes by the fold change smaller than 1.5 and kept 1250 genes in the final list. 

### Hippo signaling pathway is activated in scrib know down samples

Scrib is a gene which could directly effect the activity of yiki and so, it could effect the growth of cell by alter the hippo signal pathway. Hippo pathway is could activate the translation of wg and dally, which is on the head of wnt siganling pathway. wg is one of the key ligands which could signaling wnt canonical wnt pathway on/off. From all wing scrib related samples, we can find that NES scores is positive among all smaples (Figure G). Among then, scrib tumor in the day 6, 8, and 12 is significant which show that the activating of the hippo signaling pathway is also related with the time and development stages of the tissue.



### Wnt Signal pathway established the DNA replication and autophayge reverse pattern 

The network data is based on the string database. We selected the physical interaction drosphila data which version number is v11.5. We extracted the genes on in the list and filtered the total score smaller than 150. Befor gene filtering, we had 182,458 connenctions among 4155 genes. After filtering by both logFC and number of degree smaller than 2, we got 29,174 connections and 1250 genes. Based on this database, we use qgraphic to calculated the Fruchterman Reingold layout which is based on the smallest entropy of electron-spring model sysytem. This layout prefer to grouping frequently connected genes together and non-connected genes are far away from each other. After the layout distribution calculation, we can tell that there are 3 to 4 group by the density of special distribution and two groups based on the log2FC distribution. By judging the logFC, we can find that most of nodes from on the left are down-regulated, nodes from right are up-regulated (Fig. F). Accoding to the KGOS NES results, we believe that most gene on the down-regulated side are related to lysosom/autophage, genes on the up-regulated side are responsible for the DNA damges. By validate this idea, we need to separate them into tow group and the gene on the edge of two group in the center is the biggest changes for grouping. For avoid mannual bios, guassain smoothing is used to smoothing the logFC value and set the threshold as 0 to detect the edge of two groups (Fig. G). After that, we identified the hub gens from each group base on the number of degrees. Most importantly, we identified the cross-talking nodes (Fig. H). Among the cross talking nodes, wg is the gene has highest FC value. on the other hand, gene Dally, CanB2, and norpA is from Wnt Signaling pathway. l(2)gl is from hippop signaling pathway which is on the upstream of the wnt. This evidence shows that Wnt signaling pathway may contribute this pattern: high in DNA replication anlsd damage repair, low in lysosom and autophage activities.

### Wnt cross talk with and JNK

To further establish the key role of Wnt signaling pathway, we focused on two main organs which are eye disk and wing disc. Both of them has lots of ras-scrib tumor model data. In Wing disc model, we can find that scrib tumor model are more apt to positive score in wnt, lysosom and significantly high in Autophagy but low in DNA repair and significantly low in DNA replication (Fig. G). This data are consistant to its phnotype which show cell cycle arrest on the early stage and there are a autophage activity in abnormal arears[^Ji_19_Disease]. But when mutate scrib and ras together, this pattern is reversed: DNA replication/repair NES are up-regualted, wnt, lysosom, and autophgy's NES are down-regulated. which means that ras could suppress the autophagy in wing disc and promote the growth of the wing disc as is described in the well established research. 


(Wnt: significantly down → significantly up) Eye disk Ras-scrib are very similar to the wing disc Ras-scrib model and has a same pattern we mantioned. Suprissingly, when they mutate bsk at eye Ras-scrib model, the pattern are reversed. As a result, JNK plays an important role in this patterns. On the other hand, they also tried to disrup some genes from Jac/Stat pathway in Ras-scrib model and the NES didn't change so much though the size of tumor are rescued in some level. Thoughs all data shows that the scrib, wg, ras working together to regulate hippop, wnt and JNK signaling pathway wot keep this reversed DNA replication/repair and lysosome/autophagy activity.

JNK could place a key role in this situation, too. In a group of Eye disck Ras-scrib tumor, they also tried to block the JNK signaling pathway by using bsk dominant nagtive clone to resucue the tumor phynotype. Compared with the rescued tumor, this DNA replication/repair vs Lysosome and autophge is reversed, too. By compare with the bsk clone, the Wnt signaling pathway is significantly upregulated based on the GSEA (Fig. H) after know down the JNK signaling pathway. In the reverse, the DNA replication pathway is significantly down regulated (Fig. I). Mean while, by compare them to the control group, we can find cell death related pathway like apoptosis and mitopage is significant upregulated only in Eye Ras-scrib bsk clone and Mismatch repair and Fanconi anemia pathway are significantly upregulated in Eye Ras-scrib only. This result furthen confirmed the reversed pattern.

Nkd is upregulated in the scrib tumor but supressed after intrudeced with Ras^v12^. Nkd is a key for the activation of JNK through nonconanical wnt siganling pathway. With down regulation of the nkd, the apoptosis and autophage activities are down regulated from NES, too. So, nkd may regulated the function of the JNK by activate the cell degredation related functions.

- bsk knowdown cause the significant upregulation of wnt


- DNA replication and repair: significantly up → not significantly up


### Jun pathway activation and apoptosis activities

Scrib^-^ → JNK↑ (Marker) → Autophage↑ not Apoptophsis.
Scrib^-^ → Wnt family

JNK signaling pathway activation marker Mmp1 and puc are dramticaly upregulated in the scrib^-^ wing disc. Mean while, the apoptosis marker Dcp-1 is down regulated which the is reversed to autophage maker Atg8. This may explain that the raw research from this data shows that over expression p35 could not rescue the cell cycle hold  of wing disc-scirb tumor in the early stage[^Ji_19_Disease] because apoptosis is already been supressed and the cell degredation from the scrib^-^ wing disc is going a autophage pathway as is suggesed by GSEA (Fig. G). 

Ras^-^ → metabolism↑ → Oxidative↑
Scrib^-^ + Ras^-^ → DNA Damage↑ 

In the Eye disk tumor model, we find that the Ras mutation along is enough to upregulated different kind of metabolism pathways significantly like porphyrin metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, and retinol metabolism. Those rapid up regulated metabolism activate may induce lots of metabolism waste and cause the inbalance of oxidative environment which may explain that the oxidative activity is significantly upregulated according to the GSEA (Fig. H). Over produced ROS from oxidative activity could damage DNA and leading to the cell death. But with the exist of Scrib^-^, the hyper activate JNK but Autophage and apoptosis is suppressed. Mean while, the metabolism related pathway from Ras^v12^ alone are not sifginicant any more and oxidative signaling pathway are significantly down regulated. Under the affactes of present both Ras^v12^ and Scrib^-^, the Wnt signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorilation pathway are supressed. 

JNK is the key for this all abnormals.

JNK is well know by is both tumor supressor and contributer in tumor initiation[^Tournier_13][^Kennedy_03_cc]. Some research shows that JNK is not required in mice fibroblasts tumor[^Kennedy_03], but in our case that it plays a role in tumor initiation. Ras-scrib eye disk tumor is a very malagnent tumor and bsk^-^ could almost totally rescue the tumor phynotype. As a result, we could know that at least in the eye disck tumor modle, JNK works on the down stream of Ras and its function in Ras^-^ tumor promotion role could be blocked by JNK pathway.

Previous model believes that


Generaly, this phenomenone can not be altered by induce Ras^v12^ (Fig. K). Wnt signaling pathway is more complex than the JNK pathway. Wnt family has lots of members and Wnt2 is brodenly down regulated among both early scrib and Ras-scrib tumor. Alternatively, some Wnt signals like Wnt4 and Wnt10 is up regulated in scrib tumor 10 day, 12 day, and 14 day, but all Wnt families are down regulated on the Eye Ras-scrib tumor (Fig. J) and the NES is significantly negtive(Fig. H) which indicate that the Wnt signaling pathway is significantly supressed in Eye Ras-scrib tumor and not significantly supressed in Wnt disk Ras-scrib tumor.

## Discussion

1. scrib^-^ → hippo & Wnt


Scrib tumor could activate Hippo signaling pathway and then change the expression level of wg and dally directly. Other Scrib paralog experiments verified that the negtive regulator role in wnt signaling pathway[^Almeida_18] and more directly envidence is PDZ domains of scrib could represse the wnt signaling pathway by associalting to β-catenin which is modulated by Wnt3a[^Daulat_19]. 

2. Ras → suppress the Wnt
In wnt, with the present of wnt signaling, the dagredataion complex is recruiment by the activate form of wnt receptor and release the $\beta$-catanine which then could enter the nuclears and start to activeate the target gene translation. On the verses, dagredation complex would phospholate $\beta$-catanine and protmotes the degredation of the $\beta$-catanine. Once the position of degredation complex is released, it has the chance to recuirte other protein, ras, and promotes both Ras and $\beta$-catanine degredation[^Jeong_18][^Lee_18].

3. scrib → Wnt3a → JNK, 
Previous research shows that scrib could supress the JNK siganling pahtway[^Uhlirova_06][^Ji_19_Disease]. Wnt noncanical signaling pathway could also regulated JNK signaling pathway through. But there are rare papar talked the scrib, wnt and JNK togther. In reality, previous research already varified that Wnt3a could regulate JNK in the chronic kidney disease model[^Oh_20]. Mean while, Wnt3a's activity could be affected by scrib[^Daulat_19]. So, we have reason to believe that scrib could regulate JNK though the Wnt siganling pathways. In our re-processesd data, we find that most scrible knock down wing and eye disk tumor are activate of wnt signaling pathway and JNK pathway's activity upregulation is varifed by the data source paper[^Ji_19_Disease]. Another evidence could come from Eye Ras-scrib tumor which wnt signaling pathway is significantly up regulated after bsk know down in two indepandent studies which could lead by the compensate effects.


4. Wnt → Nkd → JNK.
JNK → App and DNA replication hold

JNK could interected with wnt through non-conanical signaling pathway. Nkd inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promote the JNK signaling pathway[^Rousset_01]. which leads both $\beta$-catanine and ras degredation. The proliferation information is disrupted and cell cycle is lost its control. Cell from wing disck started overproliferation anc companied with autophagy. Under this kind senario, ras activate form over expression could rescute the ras dagredataion and may compencate the $\beta$-catanine degredation by competition binding to the degredation complex and the wnt signaling downstream gene c-myc is upregulated. Mean while, ras could activate mTor siganling pathway to further promote the porliferaiton and induce a malignant tumor.

Down reuglate Wnt2 could induce cell cycle arrest in human keloid fibroblasts [^Cai_17] and consistance with the data of Wing sick Scrib^1^ tumor.

5. bsk → Hippo↓

Finally, JNK signaling pahtway could has cross talk with hippo, too. The bsk could suprress wts's function which could supress yki. After bsk know down, the activity of the hippo is suppresed and the wnt sugnaling pathwy is also down regulated by Ras^12v^. Mean while, the JNK signaling pahtway is tatally lost and the tumor could be rescued. As a result, bsk^DN^ could rescue the cell proliferation from Hippo pathway and abnormal cell degredation from JNK signaling pathway to rescue the effects bring by Ras^V12^ along with scrib^-^.


1. Ras could reverse then Pattern possibly by competition of the degredation of $\beta$-catanine.
1. Ras: in WD: reverse: potential reason: degredation complex competetion to aleavate wnt partialy.

Previous research results show that JNK may plays an important role in development because JNK could lead autophagy. But new evidence from eye disk Ras-scrib tumor model shows that JNK actually has a huge contribution on tumor development because that dominant-negative form, Bsk^DN^, which could inactivate JNK signaling pahtway could significantly rescue the size of the tumor[^Külshammer]. By checking the re-analysised RNA-Seq data, we found that like the Ras-scrib model, they have relatively high NES in DNA replication/repair signaling pathway. In the reverse, the wnt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and Appoptosis pathway, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis are significantly upregulated. We can find that JNK could alter lots of other pathways to build a complex network to change the altering of cell. Wnt signaling pathway could also regulated by JNK and with the up-regulation of the wnt, the size and the number of the tumor are supressed.
