# Black soldier fly larvae meal can replace fish meal in diets of sea-water phase Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)

Cite: Cummins V C, Rawles S D, Thompson K R, et al. Evaluation of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae meal as partial or total replacement of marine fish meal in practical diets for Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)[J]. Aquaculture, 2017, 473(473): 337-344.

# Abstract
- black soldier fly larvae (insect meal) replacing to fish meal
-  did not affect the apparent digestibility coefficients
(ADC) of protein, lipid, amino acids and fatty acids, or the digestive enzyme activities
- Feed intake, daily growth increase, and feed conversion ratio were also unaffected
- Whole body protein, lipid and amino acid composition were not affected
- Liver lipid accumulation was not affected by replacing the fishmeal with insect meal

# Results

## Dietary composition
