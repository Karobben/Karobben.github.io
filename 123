DensityProtein Solubility
Salting in
-Increase in solubility with increasing salt at low ionic strength
-Proteins unfold at low ionic strength and irreversibly aggregate
Salting out
- Protein precipitation at high ionic strength driven by ionic charge
shielding and solvent effects
- Solubility is minimum at isoelectric point (ionic effect)
- Effectiveness of salting out in Hoffmeister series (solvent effect):

Isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which positive and negative charges are
equally abundant on a molecule.
pI for the amino acid glycine is ~6
pI for aspartate is ~3.5
pI for lysine is ~ 9.5
-Isoelectric focusing is equilibrium electrophoresis
-Ampholytes - Mixtures of buffer molecules covering a range of pKa
values stabilize the pH gradient in an electric field
-Charged molecules, including the ampholytes, will move toward the
location where their net charge is zero. This is the isoelectric point,
or pI.Chromatography
Principle of Chromatography
-Molecules in a mobile medium move through a stationary phase
with which they can interact.
-Differential interactions with the stationary phase are the basis for
physical separation of molecules
Some stationary phases
-Paper (paper Chromatography)
-Bare silica (Thin layer chromatography)
-Functionalized Silica (Column Chromatography)
-Various polymers (acrylamide, dextran, agarose, and others)
Mobile phase is usually liquidSDS PAGE - Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate
Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
Acrylamide gel:
-Polymerized acrylamide
-Macromolecule movement
is hindered
-Movement driven by electric
field
-Mobility is determined by
charge, size and shape

Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography
-Binding to stationary phase is hydrophobic
-Elution is with organic solvents (Acetonitrile,
methanol, isopropanol, hexane)
-Often used in High Pressure Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC).Affinity Chromatography
-Retention is due to specific interaction
Typical affinity molecules:
-Antibody
-Ligand/substrate/inhibitor
-Lectin (carbohydrates)
-Nickel-Nitrilotriacetate or Ni-NTA
Binds to engineered poly Histidine
NTA and NTA + metal atom

Bouyant force depends on:
-Density Difference between
molecule and solvent
Frictional force depends on:
-Molecular shape
-Solvent viscosity
Centrifugal force depends on:
-Molecular weight
-Rotation speed
-Distance from center
Ultracentrifugation
-Can be used to obtain information on molecular weight, molecular
shape and intermolecular interactions
-Sedimentation velocity (S=Svedbergs)
-Sedimentation equilibrium
Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation
Sucrose gradient:
-Gradient is man-made and impermanent
-Sample applied at top
-Separation is by sedimentation velocity
CsCl density Gradient:
-Gradient is formed by centrifugal force

-One cycle of Edman degradation
-SDS PAGE (under reducing conditions)
Primary Sequence
-Fragmentation, purification of fragments and Edman
sequencing or mass spectroscopy

Common fragmentation methods
-Cyanogen Bromide (cleaves C-term side of Met)
-Trypsin (cleaves C-term side of Arg, Lys)
-Chymotrypsin (cleaves C-term side of Trp, Phe, Tyr)
Disulfide linkages
-SDS PAGE (reduced and non-reduced)
-Fragmentation, purification and partial sequencing with disulfide
bonds oxidized/reducedProtein Sequencing
Principles of Edman degradation:
-Cyclic, sequential removal and identification of N-terminal amino acids
-Identification is done by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
-Can sequence 50-100 residues
-Sequence determination requires overlapping fragments

Protein Mass Spectrometry
MALDI TOF - Matrix assisted laser desorption - Time of flight
ESI - Electrospray ionization
Both methods can be used to determine the molecular weight of proteins up
to ~ 105 Daltons
Molecular weight determination is unambiguousProteomics - by mass spectrometry
Genomics – The study of the an organism’s
genetic information.
Proteomics – The study of large scale protein
expression pattern in a cell type or tissue.
Genomic information is fixed. Proteomic information depends on
life cycle, environment, cell type etc.
Below: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of an E. coli whole cell extract.
Modern MALDI/SELDI mass spectrometers can identify these proteins
Often done by cutting out spots, digesting proteins with trypsin and getting the mass
of the fragments by mass spec.Determination of Protein Structure
Two methods are used to determine protein structure:
-X-ray crystallography
-Two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
X-ray crystallography
-purify protein
-grow crystals
-collect X-ray diffraction patterns
-determine electron density in three dimensions
-solve protein structure
Advantages:
-Can solve very large proteins/complexes
-Gives atomic-level resolution
Disadvantages:
-crystallization is often difficult or impossible
-crystal contacts can distort structure
