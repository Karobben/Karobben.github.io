    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Sum">Sum</h2><p>The sum symbol, represented by the Greek letter sigma (Σ), is widely used in mathematics to denote the summation of a sequence of numbers or expressions. When you see this symbol, it means you should add up a series of numbers according to the specified rule. Here’s a breakdown of how it’s typically used:</p><h3 id="Basic-Structure">Basic Structure</h3><p>The summation symbol is written as:</p><p>$$<br>\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i)<br>$$</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>$i$ is the index of summation, which takes on each integer value from $a$ to $b$, inclusive.</li><li>$a$ is the lower limit of summation, the starting value of $i$.</li><li>$b$ is the upper limit of summation, the ending value of $i$.</li><li>$f(i)$ is the function of $i$ to be summed over the range from $a$ to $b$.</li></ul><h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Sum of the first 5 natural numbers</strong>:<br>$$<br>\sum_{i=1}^{5} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15<br>$$<br>Here, $f(i) = i$, and you sum the values of $i$ from 1 to 5.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sum of the squares of the first 3 positive integers</strong>:<br>$$<br>\sum_{i=1}^{3} i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14<br>$$<br>In this example, $f(i) = i^2$, so you square each $i$ from 1 to 3 and then add them together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sum of a constant over a range</strong>:<br>Suppose you want to add the number 4, five times. The expression would be:<br>$$<br>\sum_{i=1}^{5} 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20<br>$$</p><p>Here, $f(i) = 4$, which doesn’t depend on $i$. You’re essentially multiplying 4 by the number of terms (5 in this case).</p></li><li><p><strong>Two sums</strong><br>$$<br>\sum_{i=1}^ {5}\sum_{j=2}^ {6} ij<br>$$<br>For this, you sum over $j$ from 2 to 6 for each value of $i$ from 1 to 5, and then sum those results. It’s like computing a series within another series. The operation proceeds as follows:</p><ol><li>First, fix $i$ at its starting value, 1.</li><li>Then, for $i = 1$, sum over $j$ from 2 to 6, calculating $1 \cdot j$ for each $j$ and adding them together.</li><li>Repeat this process for each value of $i$ up to 5.</li><li>Finally, sum all the results from the inner summations together.</li></ol><p>Let’s compute this step-by-step to see the result.<br>The result of the double summation $\sum_{i=1}^ {5}\sum_{j=2}^ {6} ij$ is 300. This means that when you sum the product of $i$ and $j$ for each $i$ from 1 to 5 and each $j$ from 2 to 6, the total sum is 300.<br>PS: in python:</p> <div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="PYTHON"><figure class="iseeu highlight /python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs python">N= <span class="hljs-number">0</span><br><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">6</span>):<br>    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> j <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">7</span>):<br>        N += i*j<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li></ol><h3 id="How-to-Use">How to Use</h3><ul><li><strong>Identify the sequence</strong> you need to sum. This could be a series of numbers, functions of an index, or even a constant value repeated several times.</li><li><strong>Determine the starting and ending indices</strong> ($a$ and $b$, respectively) for your summation.</li><li><strong>Write down the function or value</strong> to be summed as $f(i)$ for each $i$ in the range from $a$ to $b$.</li><li><strong>Compute each term</strong> in the series and <strong>add them together</strong> to find the total sum.</li></ul><p>Summation notation is a powerful tool in mathematics, especially for dealing with sequences and series, and it’s widely used in various fields such as statistics, physics, and finance.</p><h2 id="Product-Notation">Product Notation</h2><p>Similarly, we have <mark>product notation</mark>, too. The product symbol is represented by the Greek letter pi (Π), not to be confused with the mathematical constant $\pi$ (pi) used for the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. The product symbol is used to denote the multiplication of a sequence of numbers or expressions, just like the sum symbol is used for addition.</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{i=a}^{b} f(i)<br>$$</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>$i$ is the index of multiplication, taking on each integer value from $a$ to $b$, inclusive.</li><li>$a$ is the lower limit of the product, the starting value of $i$.</li><li>$b$ is the upper limit of the product, the ending value of $i$.</li><li>$f(i)$ is the function of $i$ to be multiplied over the range from $a$ to $b$.</li></ul><h3 id="Examples-v2">Examples</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Product of the first 5 natural numbers</strong> (also known as $5!$, factorial of 5):</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{i=1}^{5} i = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120<br>$$</p><p>This multiplies the values of $i$ from 1 to 5.</p></li></ol><p>In mathematics and particularly in machine learning, besides the summation (Σ) and product (Π) notations, another frequently used notation is the integral symbol (∫). While the summation and product notations deal with discrete sequences, the integral symbol is used for continuous functions and is fundamental in calculus. Integrals play a crucial role in various aspects of machine learning, especially in optimization, probability distributions, and understanding the area under curves (such as ROC curves).</p><h2 id="Integral-Notation">Integral Notation</h2><p>The basic structure of an integral is:</p><p>$$<br>\int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx<br>$$</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>$a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively, defining the interval over which the function $f(x)$ is integrated.</li><li>$f(x)$ is the function to be integrated over $x$.</li><li>$dx$ represents an infinitesimally small increment of $x$, indicating that the integration is performed with respect to $x$.</li></ul><h3 id="Importance-in-Machine-Learning">Importance in Machine Learning</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Optimization</strong>: Many machine learning models involve optimization problems where the goal is to minimize or maximize some function (e.g., a loss function in neural networks or a cost function in logistic regression). Integrals are essential in solving continuous optimization problems, especially when calculating gradients or understanding the behavior of functions over continuous intervals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Probability Distributions</strong>: In the context of probabilistic models and statistics, integrals are used to calculate probabilities, expected values, and variances of continuous random variables. For example, the area under the probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable over an interval gives the probability of the variable falling within that interval.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature Extraction and Signal Processing</strong>: In machine learning applications involving signal processing or feature extraction from continuous data, integrals are used to calculate various features and transform signals into more useful forms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kernel Methods</strong>: In machine learning, kernel methods (e.g., support vector machines) utilize integrals in the formulation of kernel functions, which are essential in mapping input data into higher-dimensional spaces for classification or regression tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: In the training of deep neural networks, integrals may not be explicitly visible but are conceptually present in the form of continuous optimization and in the calculation of gradients during backpropagation.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Example">Example</h3><p>Consider the problem of finding the area under a curve, which is a fundamental concept in machine learning for evaluating model performance (e.g., calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for classification problems). If $f(x)$ represents the curve, the area under $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ can be computed by the integral:</p><p>$$<br>\text{Area} = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx<br>$$</p><h2 id="Other-Frequently-Used-Notations">Other Frequently Used Notations</h2><p>This integral computes the total area under $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$, providing a measure of the model’s performance over that interval.</p><p>Integrals, along with summation and product notations, form the backbone of many mathematical operations in machine learning, from theoretical underpinnings to practical applications in data analysis, model evaluation, and optimization strategies.</p><p>Beyond summation (Σ), product (Π), and integral (∫) notations, there are several other mathematical symbols and concepts that are frequently used in machine learning and statistics. These include:</p><h3 id="Gradient-∇">Gradient (∇)</h3><p>The gradient is a vector operation that represents the direction and rate of the fastest increase of a scalar function. In machine learning, the gradient is crucial for optimization algorithms like gradient descent, which is used to minimize loss functions. The gradient of a function $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ with respect to its variables is denoted by:</p><p>$$<br>\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right)<br>$$</p><h3 id="Partial-Derivative-∂">Partial Derivative (∂)</h3><p>The partial derivative represents the rate of change of a function of multiple variables with respect to one of those variables, keeping the others constant. It’s denoted by the symbol ∂. Partial derivatives are essential in the calculation of gradients and in the optimization of machine learning models.</p><h3 id="Expectation-E">Expectation (E)</h3><p>The expectation or expected value of a random variable is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics, denoted by $E[X]$ for a random variable $X$. It represents the average or mean value that $X$ takes over its probability distribution and is crucial in understanding the behavior of models, especially in probabilistic settings.</p><h3 id="Variance-Var-and-Standard-Deviation-σ">Variance (Var) and Standard Deviation (σ)</h3><p>Variance measures the spread of a random variable’s values and is denoted by $Var(X)$ or $\sigma^2$ for a random variable $X$. The standard deviation, $\sigma$, is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the dispersion of data points around their mean value. These concepts are vital in assessing the reliability and performance of models.</p><h3 id="Covariance-and-Correlation">Covariance and Correlation</h3><p>Covariance and correlation measure the relationship between two random variables. Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables, while correlation measures both the strength and direction of this linear relationship. Understanding these relationships is essential in features selection and in modeling the interactions between variables.</p><h3 id="Big-O-Notation-O">Big O Notation (O)</h3><p>Big O notation is used to describe the computational complexity of algorithms, which is crucial in machine learning for understanding the scalability and efficiency of models and algorithms. For example, an algorithm with a complexity of $O(n^2)$ means its execution time or space requirements increase quadratically as the input size $n$ increases.</p><h3 id="Matrix-Notations-and-Operations">Matrix Notations and Operations</h3><p>Matrices and vectors are fundamental in machine learning for representing and manipulating data. Operations such as matrix multiplication, transpose, and inversion are essential for linear algebra, which underpins many machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and SVMs (Support Vector Machines).</p><p>Each of these mathematical concepts plays a crucial role in the formulation, analysis, and implementation of machine learning algorithms. They provide the theoretical foundation for understanding model behavior, optimizing performance, and evaluating outcomes in a wide range of applications.</p><h2 id="Matrix-Calculating">Matrix Calculating</h2><p>Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with extensive applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, and particularly in machine learning and data analysis. The way matrix multiplication is defined—by taking the dot product of rows and columns—might seem arbitrary at first, but it’s designed to capture several important mathematical and practical concepts.</p><p>Understanding how to perform basic operations with matrices—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (in a sense)—is crucial in linear algebra, which is foundational for many areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, and especially machine learning. Here’s a brief overview of each operation:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{pmatrix}<br>a_{11} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1j} \\<br>\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\<br>a_{i1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{ij}<br>\end{pmatrix}<br>$$</p><p>Each element within the matrix is a pair $(i,j)$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index.</p><h3 id="Matrix-Addition-and-Subtraction">Matrix Addition and Subtraction</h3><p>Matrix addition and subtraction are straightforward operations that are performed element-wise. This means you add or subtract the corresponding elements of the matrices. For these operations to be defined, the matrices must be of the same dimensions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Addition</strong>: If $A$ and $B$ are matrices of the same size, their sum $C = A + B$ is a matrix where each element $c_{ij}$ is the sum of $a_{ij} + b_{ij}$.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subtraction</strong>: Similarly, the difference $C = A - B$ is a matrix where each element $c_{ij}$ is the difference $a_{ij} - b_{ij}$.</p></li></ul><h4 id="Example-v2">Example:</h4><p>If $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 \end{pmatrix}$, then</p><ul><li>$A + B = \begin{pmatrix} 1+5 &amp; 2+6 \\ 3+7 &amp; 4+8 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 &amp; 8 \\ 10 &amp; 12 \end{pmatrix}$</li><li>$A - B = \begin{pmatrix} 1-5 &amp; 2-6 \\ 3-7 &amp; 4-8 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 &amp; -4 \\ -4 &amp; -4 \end{pmatrix}$</li></ul><h3 id="Matrix-Multiplication">Matrix Multiplication</h3><p>Matrix multiplication is more complex and involves a dot product of rows and columns. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to be multiplied, the number of columns in $A$ must equal the number of rows in $B$. If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, the resulting matrix $C = AB$ will be an $m \times p$ matrix where each element $c_{ij}$ is computed as the dot product of the $i$th row of $A$ and the $j$th column of $B$.</p><h4 id="Example-v3">Example:</h4><p>If $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 \end{pmatrix}$, then</p><ul><li>$AB = \begin{pmatrix} (1× 5 + 2× 7) &amp; (1× 6 + 2× 8) \\ (3× 5 + 4× 7) &amp; (3× 6 + 4× 8) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 19 &amp; 22 \\ 43 &amp; 50 \end{pmatrix}$</li></ul><h3 id="Matrix-Division">Matrix Division</h3><p>Matrix division as such doesn’t exist in the way we think of division for real numbers. Instead, we talk about the inverse of a matrix. For matrix $A$ to “divide” another matrix $B$, you would multiply $B$ by the inverse of $A$, denoted as $A^{-1}$. This operation is only defined for square matrices (same number of rows and columns), and not all square matrices have an inverse.</p><ul><li><strong>Multiplying by the Inverse</strong>: If you want to solve for $X$ in $AX = B$, you can multiply both sides by $A^{-1}$, assuming $A^{-1}$ exists, to get $X = A^{-1}B$.</li></ul><h4 id="Example-v4">Example:</h4><p>If $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix}$, and its inverse $A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; 1 \\ 1.5 &amp; -0.5 \end{pmatrix}$, and you want to “divide” $B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 \end{pmatrix}$ by $A$, you would compute $A^{-1}B$.</p><h3 id="Key-Points">Key Points</h3><ul><li><strong>Addition/Subtraction</strong>: Element-wise operation requiring matrices of the same dimensions.</li><li><strong>Multiplication</strong>: Involves the dot product of rows and columns, requiring the number of columns in the first matrix to equal the number of rows in the second.</li><li><strong>Division</strong>: Not directly defined, but involves multiplying by the inverse of a matrix.</li></ul><style>pre {  background-color:#38393d;  color: #5fd381;}</style>]]></content>

The product is taken over all words in the document, assuming that the words are conditionally independent of each other given the class label $Y$.</p><div class="admonition question"><p class="admonition-title">Why naïve Bayes is naïve?</p><p>We call this model &quot;naïve Bayes&quot; because the words aren't really conditionally independent given the label. For example, the sequence &quot;for you&quot; is more common in spam emails than it would be if the words &quot;for&quot; and &quot;you&quot; were conditionally independent.<br><strong>True Statement</strong>:<br></p><ul><li><em><strong>P(X = for you|Y= Spam &gt; P( W = for |Y = Spam)(P = you |= Spam)</strong></em><br>The naïve Bayes approximation simply says: estimating the likelihood of every word sequence is too hard, so for computational reasons, we'll pretend that sequence probability doesn't matter.<br></li></ul><p><strong>Naïve Bayes Approximation</strong>:<br></p><ul><li><em><strong>P(X = for you |Y = Spam) ≈ P(W = for |Y = Spam)P( W= you |Y= Spam)</strong></em><br>We use naïve Bayes a lot because, even though we know it's wrong, it gives us computationally efficient algorithms that work remarkably well in practice.</li></ul></div><h3 id="Floating-point-underflow">Floating-point underflow</h3><p>That equation has a computational issue. Suppose that the probability of any given word is roughly <em><strong>P(W = W<sub>i</sub>|Y = y) ≈ 10<sup>-3</sup></strong></em>, and suppose that there are 103 words in an email. Then <em><strong>∏<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> P(W = W<sub>i</sub>|Y = y) = 10<sup>-309</sup></strong></em>,which gets rounded off to zero. This phenomenon is called “floating-point underflow”.</p><div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Solution</p><p>$$f(x) = \underset{y}{\mathrm{argmax}} \left( \ln P(Y = y) + \sum^n_{i=1} \ln P(W = w_i | Y = y) \right)$$</p></div><h3 id="Reducing-the-naivety-of-naive-Bayes">Reducing the naivety of naïve Bayes</h3><p>Remember that the bag-of-words model is unable to represent this fact:</p><ul><li><p><strong>True Statement</strong>:</p><ul><li><em><strong>P(X = for you|Y= Spam &gt; P( W = for |Y = Spam)(P = you |= Spam)</strong></em><br>Though the bag-of-words model can’t represent that fact, we can represent it using a slightly more sophisticated naïve Bayes model, called a “bigram” model.</li></ul></li><li><p>N-Grams:</p><ul><li>Unigram: a unigram (1-gram) is an isolated word, e.g., “you”</li><li>Bigram: a bigram (2-gram) is a pair of words, e.g., “for you”</li><li>Trigram: a trigram (3-gram) is a triplet of words, e.g., “prescription for you”</li><li>4-gram: a 4-gram is a 4-tuple of words, e.g., “approved prescription for you”</li></ul></li></ul><div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Bigram naïve Bayes</p><p>A bigram naïve Bayes model approximates the bigrams as conditionally independent, instead of the unigrams.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mathmatic-Description-of-the-Light">Mathmatic Description of the Light</h2><p>In the equation you’ve provided:</p><p>$$<br>E(x,t) = E^0 \sin\left[2\pi \left(\frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}\right)\right]<br>$$</p><p>This represents a sinusoidal wave function, where $E(x,t)$ is the electric field of the light wave at a position $x$ and at time $t$. Here’s what the terms mean:</p><ul><li>$E^0$ is the amplitude of the wave, which indicates the maximum strength of the electric field.</li><li>$\lambda$ (lambda) is the wavelength of the light, which is the distance over which the wave’s shape repeats.</li><li>$T$ is the period of the wave, which is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the wave to pass a point. ($\frac{1}{T} = \nu$)</li></ul><p>The reason both $\lambda$ and $T$ are present in the equation is because they describe different aspects of the wave:</p><ul><li>$\lambda$ describes the spatial repetition of the wave along the $x$-axis.</li><li>$T$ describes the temporal repetition of the wave along the $t$-axis (time).</li></ul><p>The term $\frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}$ is the phase of the wave, which determines the position of the peaks and troughs of the wave at any given time $t$ and position $x$. It’s not meant to equal zero; instead, it changes with time and position to represent the propagation of the wave through space and time.</p><p>The phase changes as time goes by, indicating that the peaks and troughs of the wave are moving. If $\frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}$ were always zero, it would imply a stationary wave, not a propagating one.</p><p>The product $2\pi$ times the phase gives you the argument of the sine function in radians, which is necessary because the sine function is periodic with a period of $2\pi$. This means that the wave repeats itself every $2\pi$ radians, which corresponds to one wavelength in space and one period in time.</p><p><img src="https://imgur.com/D0t8uGs.png" alt="Wave Function"></p><details><summary>Plot codes</summary><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="PYTHON"><figure class="iseeu highlight /python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> plt<br><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> np<br><br><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">waveFun</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x, t = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, lamb = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, pi = np.pi, T = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, E0 = <span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>):</span><br>    E = E0 * np.sin(<span class="hljs-number">2</span> * pi * (x/lamb - t/T))<br>    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> E     <br><br>Y = <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(-<span class="hljs-number">50</span>,<span class="hljs-number">50</span>)<br>X = <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">100</span>)<br>Points = []<br><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> X:<br>    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> Y:<br>        Dis = np.sqrt((x/<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)**<span class="hljs-number">2</span> + (y/<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)**<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)<br>        Points += [[x, y, waveFun(Dis)]]<br><br>Points = np.array(Points)<br><br>plt.figure(figsize=(<span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>))<br>plt.scatter(Points[:, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>], Points[:, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] + <span class="hljs-number">0.5</span>, c= Points[:, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>], marker=<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;o&#x27;</span>, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm,)<br>plt.show()<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></details><h3 id="Example-1-Single-Location-Position">Example 1: Single Location Position</h3><p>Let’s set the $\lambda$ as 1, T as 10, and x = 0.

It makes it very clear that the wave repeats itself every wavelength λ in space and every period T in time.</p><p>The second function is the standard form. It's particularly useful in more advanced topics like wave interference, diffraction, and quantum mechanics, where the concept of phase space and the relationship between position and momentum (or wavelength and frequency) are crucial.</p><p>For example, when you want to mimic the interference of the wave, the previous function could became extreamly complcated because the only difference between two wave is phase.</p></div><details> <summary>More descriptions</summary>These equations describe how the electric and magnetic fields oscillate as a function of space and time, which is characteristic of electromagnetic waves such as light. The quantities $E^0$ and $H^0$ are the maximum strengths of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.<p>In an electromagnetic wave, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. The equations show that both fields oscillate in sync (they have the same phase $\phi$) but are described by separate equations since they are perpendicular components.</p><p>The term $kx - \omega t$ indicates that the wave is moving in the positive $x$-direction. If the wave were moving in the negative $x$-direction, the sign in front of $\omega t$ would be positive.</p><p>The factor $\sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)$ varies between (-1) and (1), causing the electric and magnetic field strengths to oscillate between $-E^0$ to $E^0$ and $-H^0$ to $H^0$, respectively. The wave thus carries energy and, if it is light, can be observed as it interacts with matter.</p></details><h2 id="Huygen’s-Principle-1678">Huygen’s Principle (1678)</h2><p>Waves spread as if each

S. Lee</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Immunoglobulins, commonly known as antibodies, are crucial proteins in the immune system that recognize and bind to specific antigens, such as bacteria and viruses, to help protect the body. Their structure is both unique and complex, consisting of several key components:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Basic Structure</strong>: Immunoglobulins are Y-shaped molecules made up of four polypeptide chains - two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains.

These regions are highly diverse and are responsible for the antigen-binding specificity of the antibody.</li><li><strong>Constant Regions</strong>: The rest of the molecule forms the constant region, which is relatively conserved across different antibodies.

It represents the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and is a foundational aspect of the IMGT® information system. Developed by Marie-Paule Lefranc and her team, IMGT/Ontology provides a standardized vocabulary and a set of concepts that are essential for the consistent annotation, description, and comparison of the immune system’s components across different species. So, <strong>IMGT/Ontology is more of a set of criteria or a framework rather than a specific tool or software.</strong></p><p>Key features and aspects of IMGT/Ontology include:</p><details><summary>1. Standardized Vocabulary</summary>IMGT/Ontology provides a controlled vocabulary for the description of immunogenetic sequences. This includes terms for genes, alleles, and other genetic elements relevant to immunogenetics.</details><details><summary>2. Classification Criteria</summary>It establishes clear and standardized criteria for the classification of immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TCR), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This classification is crucial for the accurate comparison and analysis of these molecules.</details><details><summary>3. Identification of Key Concepts</summary>The ontology identifies and defines key concepts in immunogenetics, such as gene segment functionality, recombination features, and junctional diversity. These concepts are critical for understanding the adaptive immune response.</details><details><summary>4. IMGT-ONTOLOGY Axioms</summary>These are the rules that define the relations between the concepts and are used for the annotation and description of the IG, TCR, and MHC sequences in the IMGT® databases and tools.</details><details><summary>5. Facilitating Data Integration and Analysis</summary>By providing a common framework and language, IMGT/Ontology enables the integration, analysis, and sharing of immunogenetic data across different research projects and databases.</details><details><summary>6.

However, it typically processes and analyzes these chains separately. When you input a sequence that contains both heavy and light chains, IgBLAST might only process the first recognizable sequence, which in your case appears to be the heavy chain.</p><p>To analyze both heavy and light chains using IgBLAST, you generally need to input them as separate sequences. This means splitting your combined sequence into two parts - one for the heavy chain and the other for the light chain - and then running IgBLAST for each part individually.</p><p>There isn't a parameter in IgBLAST that allows for the simultaneous analysis of both heavy and light chains when they are combined into a single sequence. The tool's algorithm is designed to identify and annotate the V(D)J segments of a single chain at a time, as the structure and sequence features of heavy and light chains are distinct.</p><p>If you are consistently working with sequences that contain both chains, you may need to develop a preprocessing step in your workflow to separate these chains before analysis. Alternatively, if such a tool is essential for your work, you might need to look into other bioinformatics tools or custom scripting to first identify and separate the heavy and light chain sequences before feeding them into IgBLAST.</p></div><style>pre {  background-color:#38393d;  color: #5fd381;}</style>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="SSH">SSH</h2><p>SSH, short for Secure Shell, is a network protocol used to securely access and manage a computer over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an unencrypted network, like the internet, allowing users to log into another computer, execute commands remotely, and move files. SSH uses strong encryption to protect the data being transmitted, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data against eavesdropping and interception. It’s commonly used by system administrators and IT professionals for managing systems and applications remotely.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-It">How to Use It</h2><p>Using SSH typically involves two primary components: an SSH client and an SSH server. The server runs on the machine you want to connect to, while the client runs on the machine you’re connecting from. Here’s a basic guide on how to use SSH:</p><h3 id="Setting-Up-an-SSH-Server">Setting Up an SSH Server</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Install SSH Server</strong>: On the remote machine (the one you want to access), you need to install an SSH server. For Linux systems, this is often done using the <code>openssh-server</code> package.</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo apt update<br>sudo apt install openssh-server<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><p>This example is for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu). The commands might vary for other systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Start and Enable SSH Service</strong>: Ensure that the SSH service is started and enabled to start on boot.</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo systemctl start ssh<br>sudo systemctl <span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span> ssh<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Configure SSH Server (Optional)</strong>: You can configure your SSH server by editing the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file. This step is optional and typically only necessary for advanced configurations.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Connecting-Using-an-SSH-Client">Connecting Using an SSH Client</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Install SSH Client</strong>: Most Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) come with an SSH client pre-installed. For Windows, you can use clients like PuTTY or use the built-in SSH client in Windows 10/11.</p></li><li><p><strong>Establish an SSH Connection</strong>: To connect to the SSH server, you need the IP address or hostname of the server and the username on that system. The basic command is:</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh [username]@[host]<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><p>For example, if your username is <code>user</code> and the server’s IP address is <code>192.168.1.100</code>, you would use:</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh user@192.168.1.100<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Authenticate</strong>: When you connect for the first time, you’ll be asked to verify the identity of the server. After accepting, you’ll be prompted for the password of the user account you are logging into on the remote machine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using SSH</strong>: Once connected, you can execute commands on the remote machine as if you were physically present.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transferring Files (Optional)</strong>: SSH also allows for secure file transfer using SCP or SFTP.</p><ul><li>To copy a file from your local machine to the remote machine:<div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">scp /path/to/<span class="hljs-built_in">local</span>/file user@192.168.1.100:/path/to/remote/directory<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li><li>To copy a file from the remote machine to your local machine:<div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">scp user@192.168.1.100:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/<span class="hljs-built_in">local</span>/directory<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Exiting SSH</strong>: To end your SSH session, simply type <code>exit</code> or press <code>Ctrl+D</code>.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Configure-file">Configure file</h2><p><code>vim ~/.ssh/config</code></p><pre>Host home_pc    HostName 192.168.3.1    User john    Port 2322</pre><p>How to login this host:<br><code>ssh home_pc</code></p><h3 id="Security-Considerations">Security Considerations</h3><ul><li><p><strong>SSH Keys</strong>: For better security, it’s recommended to use SSH keys instead of passwords. SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys that can be used to authenticate to an SSH server as an alternative to password-based logins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Firewall Settings</strong>: Make sure your firewall settings allow SSH connections (usually on port 22).</p></li><li><p><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Keep the SSH server software up to date for security.</p></li></ul><p>SSH is a powerful tool for remote administration, but it’s important to use it securely to protect your systems and data.</p><h2 id="SSH-Key">SSH Key</h2><p>Generating an SSH key is a security practice for authenticating to an SSH server more securely than using just a password. Here’s why you should do it and how to generate an SSH key:</p><h3 id="Why-Use-SSH-Keys">Why Use SSH Keys?</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: SSH keys are cryptographic keys that are much more secure than passwords. They are almost impossible to decipher using brute force methods.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Need for Passwords</strong>: When you use SSH keys, you don’t need to enter your password every time you connect, which reduces the risk of password theft.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automation Friendly</strong>: SSH keys are ideal for automated processes. Scripts and applications can authenticate without manual password entry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Access Control</strong>: SSH keys can be used to control who can access a server. Only users with the matching private key can access the server configured with the public key.</p></li></ol><h3 id="How-to-Generate-an-SSH-Key">How to Generate an SSH Key</h3><h4 id="On-Linux-or-macOS">On Linux or macOS:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Open Terminal</strong>: Launch the terminal application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generate Key Pair</strong>: Use the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command to generate a new SSH key pair.</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><p>This command creates a new SSH key using the RSA algorithm with a key size of 4096 bits, providing a good balance between security and compatibility. You can choose other algorithms like <code>ed25519</code> which is considered more secure but may not be compatible with older systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Specify File to Save the Key</strong>: By default, <code>ssh-keygen</code> will save the key in the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> file. You can specify a different file if you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enter a Passphrase (Optional)</strong>: For additional security, you can enter a passphrase when prompted. This passphrase will be required whenever the private key is used.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Adding-the-SSH-Key-to-Your-SSH-Server">Adding the SSH Key to Your SSH Server</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Copy Public Key</strong>: After generating your SSH key, you need to add the public key to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file on your SSH server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> on Linux/macOS</strong>: If you’re using Linux or macOS, you can use <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to copy your public key to the server easily.</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh-copy-id user@server-address<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Manual Copying</strong>: If <code>ssh-copy-id</code> isn’t available or you’re using Windows, you can manually copy the public key text and append it to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the server.</p></li></ol><p>Remember, never share your private key. The public key is what you distribute or add to servers, while the private key should be securely stored and kept private.</p><h2 id="Trouble-Shooting-Public-Key-Doesn’t-Work">Trouble Shooting: Public Key Doesn’t Work</h2><p>If your SSH public key authentication isn’t working, there could be several reasons. Here’s a troubleshooting guide to help you resolve common issues:</p><h3 id="1-Check-File-Permissions">1. Check File Permissions</h3><ul><li><strong>On the Server</strong>: SSH is particular about file permissions for the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory and the <code>authorized_keys</code> file. Incorrect permissions can prevent SSH from authenticating using keys.<ul><li>The <code>~/.ssh</code> directory should have permissions set to <code>700</code> (drwx------).</li><li>The <code>authorized_keys</code> file should have permissions set to <code>600</code> (-rw-------).</li><li>Use the <code>chmod</code> command to set these permissions:</li></ul></li></ul><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">chmod 700 ~/.ssh<br>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><h3 id="2-Ensure-Correct-Ownership">2. Ensure Correct Ownership</h3><p>The <code>.ssh</code> directory and the <code>authorized_keys</code> file should be owned by the user, not root or any other user. Use the <code>chown</code> command to set the ownership:</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">chown -R your_username:your_username ~/.ssh<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><p>You can also make sure that the home directory permissions are restricted to the user. I think it could do the same thing.</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">chmod -R u+rwX,go-rwx /home/your_username<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><h3 id="3-Verify-the-Public-Key-Format">3. Verify the Public Key Format</h3><p>Ensure that the public key in <code>authorized_keys</code> is in the correct format. It should be a single line starting with <code>ssh-rsa</code> or <code>ssh-ed25519</code>, followed by the key, and optionally a comment.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-SSH-Server-Configuration">4. Check the SSH Server Configuration</h3><p>The SSH server configuration file (<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>) on the server might restrict public key authentication. Check the following settings:</p><ul><li><code>PubkeyAuthentication yes</code> should be set to allow public key authentication.</li><li><code>AuthorizedKeysFile</code> should point to the correct path, typically <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</li><li>If <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> is set to <code>no</code>, the server will not fall back to password authentication if key authentication fails.</li><li>After making changes, restart the SSH service:</li></ul><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo systemctl restart ssh<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><h3 id="5-Check-SSH-Client-Configuration">5. Check SSH Client Configuration</h3><p>On your client machine, ensure you’re specifying the correct private key. If you’re using a key with a non-default name or location, specify it with the <code>-i</code> option:</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh -i /path/to/private_key user@server<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><h3 id="6-Look-at-Server-Logs">6. Look at Server Logs</h3><p>SSH server logs can provide details on why the key authentication is failing. Check the logs for relevant error messages:</p><ul><li>On most Linux systems, SSH logs are located in <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> or <code>/var/log/secure</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Validate-Key-Pair">7. Validate Key Pair</h3><p>Ensure that the public and private keys are a matching pair. If you have regenerated or changed keys, make sure the server has the corresponding public key.</p><h3 id="8-Check-Passphrase">8. Check Passphrase</h3><p>If your private key is protected with a passphrase, ensure you’re entering the correct passphrase when prompted.</p><h3 id="9-Network-Issues">9. Network Issues</h3><p>Confirm there are no network issues preventing SSH access. Firewall settings on either the client or server side can block SSH connections.</p><h3 id="10-Client-Side-Debugging">10. Client-Side Debugging</h3><p>Use SSH with the <code>-vvv</code> option for verbose output, which can give more insights:</p><div class="highlight-wrap"autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true"data-rel="BASH"><figure class="iseeu highlight /bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs bash">ssh -vvv -i /path/to/private_key user@server<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><p>This will provide detailed debug information about each step of the SSH connection process, potentially highlighting where the issue lies.</p><style>pre {  background-color:#38393d;  color: #5fd381;}</style>]]></content>
