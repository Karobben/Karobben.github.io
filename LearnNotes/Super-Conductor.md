# BCS theory
**(Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory)**


| The properties of Type I superconductors were modeled successfully by the efforts of John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer in what is commonly called the BCS theory. A key conceptual element in this theory is the pairing of electrons close to the Fermi level into Cooper pairs through interaction with the crystal lattice. This pairing results from a slight attraction between the electrons related to lattice vibrations; the coupling to the lattice is called a phonon interaction. -- [R Nav](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/bcs.html)<br /><br />1. Electron moves through the lattice will pull the atoms in lattice, and bunches positives charges together as a result.<br />1. The positive charges will pull another electron into the first wake, Cooper pair formed between the two particulars.<br />1. Those pairs behavior like waves  name as Bose-Einstein condensate that is too large to be impeded by the lattice and so flows through it without any resistance at all.<br /> | ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/691897/1579770495533-f692d8cd-80e2-4c2e-b818-6336e095a663.png#align=left&display=inline&height=892&name=image.png&originHeight=892&originWidth=317&size=136818&status=done&style=none&width=317)<br />**©2019 Scientific American** |

# Machine learning in super conductor
2018, one algorithm trained on a database of thousands of materials, developed ability to identify superconductors in another data set with 92 percent accuracy and to estimate their critical temperatures.<br />It did so using only simple elemental properties such as atomic weight and melting temperature. 

Shortcoming: There is something you do which works, and you just keep doing exactly the same thing to make it work, and why you do it you have no idea. --Somayazulu
