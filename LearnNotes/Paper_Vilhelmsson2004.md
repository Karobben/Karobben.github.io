# Abstract
1. Substitute gradient
2. SPC15 has a best growth performance
3. SPC75 has a worst growth performance
4. SPC 15 and SPC30 had the highest protein efficiency ratio
5. Daily feed intake was significantly decreased
6. Survival rate were higher in SPC15, SPC30, and SPC45
7. SPC15 and SPC30 showed significantly higher protein and amino acid (AA) retention

# M&M
- Diet formulation
- Feeding trial
- Sample collection and calculation formula for growth performance
- Biochemical analysi
- Statistical analysis
- QEthical statement

# Results
- Growth performance and biometry
- Nutritional composition
- Protein and individual AA ADCs and retention in muscle

> ## Growth performance and biometry
> - Survival
>   - SPC 15, SPC 30, and SPC 45 (from 94% to 96%) as compared to SPC 60 and SPC 75 (P < 0.05)
> - BWG, WGR, SGR, and PER
>   - SPC15
>   - BWG: average body weight gain; WGR: Weight gain ratio; SGR: specific growth rate, survival; PER: protein efficiency ratio
> - FCR (feed conversion ratio)
>     - SPC15
> - DFI (Daily feed intake)
>     -  SPC0
>
> ## Nutritional composition
> ![YTXJkn.png](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/20/YTXJkn.png)
> - Muscle protein
>   - SPC0, SPC15, SPC30 > SPC45, SPC60, SPC75
> - Whole Body
>   - Moisture content gradually increased
> - Crude protein
>   - SPC30, SPC45 > SPC60, SPC75
> - Muscle AA
>   - histidine, lysine and methionine
>     - Negative related
>     - Methionine: H, SPC30; L, SCP75
>     - Lysine: H, SPC15； L，SPC75


# Discussion

## P1 Introduction
- Other studies
- This experiment

## P2 Regression Model
Predict the best ratio for Growth performance improving

## P3 Tolerate Comparing
Some fish have high tolerate of plant meal but not Grouper

## P4 Growth Performance & feed intake
Growth performance related but not depend by feed intake.
The best growth performance is SPC15, but the highest uptake ratio is SPC0

## P5 Poor Nutrition Value
Anti Nutrition Factors (ANF) & Lower Content of Amino Acids
- *ANF*
  - phytic acid, trypsin inhibitor, raffinose, and glycinin
  - phytic, trypsin: feed intake and growth

## P6-7 Phytic and Trypsin
- Mild effects on growth compared with previous studies: We have a lower concentration of phytic as well as trypsin.
- (Other studies) reduction in the bio-availability of Phosphorus, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc

## P8-9 General Conclusion
## P10 Summary



# Conclusion

SPC 11-14% can optimize the growth performance.
SPC30 can still remain beneficial for the grouper.
