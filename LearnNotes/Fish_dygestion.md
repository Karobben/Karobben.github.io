# Sharks
reference:[The Shark Digestive System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELIGC3vDFeo)
## Digestive Tracks
1. Mouth
Grain Foods
Lack of salivary amylase
2. Esophagus
3. Stomach
4. Spiral Intestine (small intestine)
The place absorption and nutrients and toxins take palce
>- Duodenum (the first part of the spiral intestine)
>>- pyloric sphincter/ pylorus (First part of Duodenum)
>> The muscle expands and contrast to control the food into the duodenum  
(Spiral valve in the inside of intestine)
5. Colon (an enlarged Intestine)
> - water absorption
6. Rectum and Cloaca (the waste expelled)

## Digestive Organ
### Liver
- detoxification (hepatic portal system)
> - HPS: gathering the blood from the GI track and taking it back to the liver to be detox.
- storage Clucose
- produces vile
- Squalene (Shark)
  It allows buoyancy because the oil is lighter than water
- bile (looks like green blister)
 stores at gallbladder

### Spleen
Produces, stores, and breaks down blood cells
** Major Part of Immune system** for shark(fish)

### Pancreas
- exocrine function: Pancreatic juices.
- endocrine function: regulating blood sugar (insulin).

### Rectal Gland
salt gland: salty homeostasis

# Digestive System and Physiology of Digestion in Fishes
reference:[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Z8gEFeOAk)

## Pancrease
1. exocrine secretion into Intestine
2. Endocrine secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon

## Liver
1. Priduce **bile**
2. synthesis and stores **glycogen**

## Other Glands
1. Mucosal & sybmucosal lining of the fish contain some glands
2. Glandular structure of stomach comprises the gastric glands in the cardiac and the pyloric regions

## Gastric Phase of Digestion
### Pepesin
*predominant gastric enzyme*
### Trypsin
### Carbohydrases
