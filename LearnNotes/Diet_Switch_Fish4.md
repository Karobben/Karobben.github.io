# Abstract
1. Three experimental diet (50%, 75%, 100%)
2. Rainbow trout and gilthead sea bream
3. Compare the digestion enzymes
4. **Post-prandial protease** and **α-amylase** activities
5. **protease** Activities change
6. chymotrypsin-like bands
7. **α-amylase** activities does not affected
8. **histology** Change
9. **intestinal length**
10. **Weight** change only on PP100
# Introduction

##P1: Plant protein substitution for economy

Shortcomings:
  - hgih carbohydrate levels
  - isoflavones
  - low methionine levels
  - anti-nutritional factors

They can:
  - impede protein digestion
  - impair immune responses
  - intestinal inflammation.

End: Yellow perch is one of the most sensitive species for this change.

## P2: Pancreas
1. Serine-protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and collagenase)
2. Glucosidases
>- hydrolyze starch into lineal chains

## P3: Our purpose
1. Protine and Carbohydrate digestion
2. histology

# M&M
- Chemicals
- Diets, animals and growth experiment
- Post-parndial experiment and sampling
- Preparation of extracts and determination of soluble protein
- Enzyme assays
- Zymograms: characterization of protease fractions and inhibition by PP diets
- Proximal intestine histological analysis
- Statistical analysis

# Results

## Enzymes activities
### Alkaline Protease
- Trout fed diets PP50 and PP75 showed only a slight post-feeding increase in this activity.
- Sea bream fed the FM diet showed a maximum of 6.93±1.03 U protease·mg− 1 protein·min− 1. This value decreased gradually as the percentage of plant protein increased

### Amylase
a significant post-prandial increase in this activity was recorded only in PP75 and PP100 fed trout. Replacement of fish meal by plant protein did not induce significant changes in α-amylase activity in either species.
