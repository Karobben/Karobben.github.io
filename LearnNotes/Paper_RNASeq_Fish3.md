# Abstract
1. fishmeal  & Rapeseedmeal to explore the effects of protein source.
2. Two strains are feed.
3. Growth performance,body composition, hematologic indices, and hepatic transcriptomes were measured.
4. A prefer FM, F prefer RM
5. Different involved in lots of metabolic pathways

```

P2: Previous mainly researches are focus on dietary background, genetic backgrounds are essential, too. As a result, understanding of molecular mechanisms is needed.

P3: NGS could achieving it. See bass response similar to fishmeal diet, but response different to plant-based diet.

P4:G. carp is important. A: fast growth; B: fast growth & Diseases resist.

# Discussion

## P1-2 Poor Growth Performance
- Different response to plant protein. It is regulated by the gene in liver which involved in protein/lipid metabolism.
- Metabolic, digestive, cell signals... are also changed.
- Metabolic response interact with genotype.

## P3 Essential Amino Acids.

Challenges:
- The rapeseeds lack of *lysine* and *methionine*.
- Imbalanced amino acid diet.

Responds:
- Low body protein deposition
- OAT(***ornithine aminotransferase***) improved to generates more nonessential AA.

## P4 Lipid metabolism
- ***hmdh*** high expression: Cholesterol Synthesis;
- Appropriate explanation: Plant sterols affect membrane properties, modify phospholipid order, impair cholesterol absorption. To response it, liver increased the cholesterol synthesis.

## P6 Overall
...

## Different responses to RM diet between strains
- **F better use RM than A.(similar found in rainbow trout)**
- **RAN-seq in strain F feed with RM**
  - Digestive enzyme activated
  - Higher plasma AA at 2h after diet
  - Better growth performance
  - Genes included in *assy, gcsp2, serc* expressed lower
  - higher PRE
- **RAN-seq in strain A feed with RM**
  - immune response-related genes, including xxx, but unaltered in strain F.
  - This indicate higher inflammatory response in strain A, associated some other reports.
- Strain F has lower LRE with RM group.
  - arachidonic acid metabolism were lower in F, which related to immune responses.
  -  F had lower lipid deposition to lower inflammatory responses
  - Genes, like XXX, related phospholipid metabolism had lower expression in F.
- **Take together**
  - Diet had interaction with Genotype.

PS

I think that the author did a good job on the discussion secession.
First of all, he mad a conclusion about the Growth performance of the corps. This is what what we can see at the first glance, and one of the direct purpose of this experiment. On the other hand, the author gave a general summery of the different in metabolic, digestives, and cell signals change, etc.

After that, the author focused on two widely concerned challenges in plant meals: lacking of some essential amino acids and lipid deficiency. As a result, the body protein deposition was definitely affected and ***oat*** was involved in Nitrogen compensate. About the Lipid metabolism, they found that the gene ***hmdh*** are respond to keep cholesterol homeostasis.

After this discussion, the author are focused in talking about the interaction of the diet and genotype, the part makes this experiment unique.

Above of, this discussion is a good example to show how to handle a discussion, how to write a story logically and neatly.
