# Abstract
1. Plant protein diet substitute became more and more common.
2. Purpose of this paper.
3. Experiment Design.
4. Resutl
5. Conclusion

# Introduction

##P1: Is Soybean awesome?(BG information of Soybean meal)

Shortcomings:
  - hgih carbohydrate levels
  - isoflavones
  - low methionine levels
  - anti-nutritional factors

They can:
  - impede protein digestion
  - impair immune responses
  - intestinal inflammation.

End: Yellow perch is one of the most sensitive species for this change.

## P2: Impacts
It has more negative affects on juvenile fish than adults.

## P3: Transcriptomic Studies
1. Short period study: Lots of related studies have been down and show that the digestive and metabolic system were impaired.
2. Long period(12 weeks) studies: Increased in immune related and inflammation related genes, and donw regulation of metabolic pathway.

## P4
This Experiment is unique!!!
P4:G. carp is important. A: fast growth; B: fast growth & Diseases resist.

# Discussion

## P1 Introduction
- Plant protein is imperative
- Potential utility: optimal feeds
- Previous studies has

## P2
BG information (PS: I don't think this paragraph is needed...)

## P3
Weight are not significantly different. Acceptance diet.

## P4 Intestine
Previous studied revealed three different regions of intestine. And the **mid region** is the target. (PS: Does the author try to show that this design of the experiment is appropriate or??)

## P5 Up-regulated gene in mid gut
- cholesterol biosynthesis
- cholesterol is only found in animal materials.
- cholesterol intake was impaired by phytosterols.

## P6 Cholesterol Biosynthesis
- genes, rate-controlling enzyme ware up-regulated.
- Increasing the synthesis of cholesterol to matain the homeostasis.

## P7 Growth Performance
- Reduced cholesterol levels can cause a reduction in growth
- Support cholesterol to improving growth.
- cholesterol synthesis is a high energy expenditure.
- Compounds are highly involved in fatty acid

## P8 lipid
- Gene involved in lipid metabolism and transport were up-regulated.
- This change is involved in cholesterol homeostasis.
- The change happens in intestine as well as livers compared with previous experiment.

## P9 Over Overall
- Despite the changes, the total body lipid doesn't have a significantly different after 61 days of feeding.
- So as the cholesterol.
- Increased cholesterol biosynthesis is compensated the lower diet intake.
- This result is different from a study done in rainbow trout.
- Plasma cholesterol content reduces in European seabass and Atlantic salmon with SPM feeding.
- Explain: excess cholesterol in the body is stored


# Conclusion

Though, total weight and lipid are not significantly changed between two groups is because some how the fish compensated the different, like de novo cholesterol.

It is one of the first study that ...   main the growth.
 biosynthesis
