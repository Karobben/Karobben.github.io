# TED听抄2: If you Don't understand Quantum Physics, Try This!

Quantum Physics has been mythically complicate and hard to understand.  
In fact, **Richard Feynmann** who won the Nobel Prise for his work on quantum electron dynamic said, "If you think you understand quantum physics, you don't understand quantum physics." Which is kind of **disheartening** for us, because if he didn't understand it, what chance that reset of us have?  

Fortunately, this quota is a little bit misleading. We do effect understand Quantum Physics really well. In fact, is arguably the most successful scientific theory out there. And that let us invent technologies like computers, digital cameras, LED screens, lasers, nuclear power plants. You know you don't really want to build a nuclear power plant if you don't really understand how it works.  

So, Quantum Physics is just a part of physics that describe very small of things in our Universe, molecules, atoms, subatomic particles things like that. That thing don't down quiet work the same way that we used to up here. This is fascinating, because you and everything around you are made from Quantum Physics. And so, this is really hall of whole universe is actually working.

As drawing this protons, neutrons, and electrons as particles, but in Quantum Mechanics, we really describe everything as waves. By the way, I am using the Quantum Physics and Quantum Mechanics inter-change be that is the same thing. So, instead an electron looking like this (a dot), it should look something like this(a wave). This is called a *Wavefunction*. But this *wavefunction* isn't a real physical wave like a wave on water or sound-wave. The Quantum Wave is an abstract mathematical description.

To get the real word properties like positional and momentums of an electron, we have to do mathematical operations on this *wavefunction*. So, for the position, we take the amplitude and square it, which for this wave will looks something like this. This gives us things called probability distribution. Which tells us that your are more like to find electron here than here. And when we actually measure where the electron is, an electron Popsicle pops up somewhere in this area. So, in Quantum Physics, we don't know anything with infinite details, could only predict the probabilities of that things happen. And it looks like the fundamental feature of the universe, which is quiet **deparcher** from the clock work to determines of university in classical physics, the kind of thing Newton derived.  

This way function model predicts what subatomic particles will do is incredibly well. But wirely, we have got no idea of this *wavefunction* is literately real or not. No ones ever seen a quantum waves because whenever we measure an electron, all we have seen is a point like electron particle. So, there's like there is a hide quantum realm where the wave is exist, and then, the word we can sem, which is all the waves turned into particles. And a barrier between this is measurement. We say that the measurement collapse it's *wavefunction*. But we don't actually have any physics to describe how the wave collapses. This is a gap on knowledge that we've doubt the measurement problems, and this is one of the things that Feynmann was referring to with this quote.  

Another confusing things is how exactly picture an electron. It seems to be a wave until you measure it, and then, it is a particle. So, what actually is it? It's know as particle-wave duality and here is an example for action for Feynmann's famous double slit experiment.  

Imaging spring a paper gun, into a wall with two opening in it. It is inspect to see two columns of pint go through and hit the wall behind. But if you shrink this all dots into electrons, you seen something quite different. You can fire one electrons at a time out the slits, and they appear on the back wall. But as they build up over time, you get a whole pattern of stripes instead of just two bands. This pattern of stripes was called interference pattern. Some thing you only seem with waves. The idea is that it's electron wave that goes through both slits at the same time, and then the waves from each slit overlap with each other. In where the waves get together, you get high probability of electron popping up in the wall. But where the waves comes rare the  probabilities are very low. So, actually on the back wall, the highest probability of you find the electron is in the middle of the slits. And then it goes down, and up and and up-down again. This is the interference pattern. So, if you fire one electron after another, they follow this probabilities distribution, and this interference pattern start building up and thats exactly what we see in the experiment.  

So, this shows that electrons behave like waves in this experiment. The question is what actually happens to this spread out electron wave when you do measurement. Seems like you go through this spread out wave to this look like particle. But like I said, this is nothing in Quantum Mechanics that tell us how the *wavefunction* collapses. And this is not the only true for electrons. That everything in the universe. So, this double slits experiments has huge consequence from modeling universe. And it's very surprising the first time when it was down.  

Physicists are still **grapling** with this question today and come up with many interpretations of quantum mechanics and trying to explain this results, and explaining, how reality actually works.  

Ok, let's go back to the *wavefunction*, we can now use this picture to explain other feature of Quantum Physics that you may have heard about. So, this is just one possible wave function for electron. But there have many others. Like this one for instance. This says it as an electron has probabilities have been here and probabilities over been here. And very little probability have been in the middle. This is perfectly allowed in Quantum Physics. And this wither Frams thinks can be two place in once comes from. This is know as *superposition*, which comes from the fact that this wave made by adding or super-imposing this two waves. The word *superposition* just means the adding together of the waves. We already saw this in double slit experiment. And It's not really a very special phenomenon. You can even seen *superposition* by draping two **paddles** into a pond to see the repels overlap.

Now for entanglement. (See you next time)
