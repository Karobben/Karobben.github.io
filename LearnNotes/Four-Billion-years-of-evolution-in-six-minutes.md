# TED听抄1: Four Billion years of evolution in six minutes

If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

Will, because we are not monkeys, we are fish.

Now, knowing you are a fish and not a monkey is actually really important to understanding where we came from.

I teach one of the largest evolution biological class in the US, and when my students finally understand why I am call them fish all the time, then, I know, I am getting my job done.

But I always have to start my classes by dispelling something hardwired myth, because that was really knowing it, many of us were taught evolution wrong.

For instance, we are taught to say the theory of evolution, there are actually many theories, and just like the process itself, the one that best fit the data are the one that survive to this day. The one we know best it Darwin Natural Selection. That's the processes by which organism that best fit the environment to survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fitted, slowly die off. And that's it. Evolution as simple as that, And it is the facts.

Evolution is a facts as much as the theory of gravity. You can prove it just easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share with other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share with other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share with all other life on Earth.

Those trace doesn't pop up in humans. There are past down from different ancestor to all the descendants, not just us. But that's not really how we learn biology early on, isn't? We learn plants and bacteria are primitive things, fish give rise to amphibians, followed by reptiles and mammals, then, you get you, this perfectly evolved creature at the end of the line. The life doesn't evolve in a line and it doesn't end with us. But we're always shown evolution portraits something like this. From monkeys into chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward in steady march to becoming us. But they don't become us any more then we would become them. We also not the goal of evolution.

But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand evolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution has led to many problems, but you can't ask that question, that age-old question that, where are we from, without understanding evolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has let to many **convoluted** and **corrupted** views of how we should tread other life on the earth and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So, let's go back, 4 billion years.

This is the single-cell organism we all came from. At first, it give rise to other single-cell of life. But these are still evolving to this day. and some would say the Archaea and bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going to be here well after us.

About three billion years ago, multicellularity evolved. This includes fungi, plants, and animals. The first animals to develop a backbone were fishes. So, technically, all vertebrates are fishes. So, technically, you and I are fish. So, don't said I didn't warn you.

One fish lineage came into the land and give rise to among other things, the mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds, some mammals become primates. Some primates become monkeys with tail, And others become the great apes, including variety of human species. So, you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share a common ancestor. All the whole, life around us kept evolving. More bacteria, more fungi, lots of fish, fish, fish, if you couldn't tell, yes, they're my favorite group. As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last for a few million years. So, you see most life on earth that we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So, is **hubris**, is **self-centered** to think, Oh, plants and bacteria are <u>primitive</u>. And we've been here for an evolutionary minute, so  we are somehow special.  

Think of life as being this book, and unfinished book for sure. We are just seeing the last few pages of each chapter. If you look out on the 8 million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being 4 billion years of evolution. They are all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life. All of us are connected by invisible branches, not just to each other, but to our extincted relatives, and our evolutionary ancestors.

As an biologist, I am still trying to learn with others, how everyone's related to each other, who is related to whom. Perhaps, it is batter still to think us as a little fish out of the water. Yes, the one that learned walk and talk. The one that still has a lot of learning to do about who we are, and where we came from. Thank you!!!
