# Abstract
## BG
1. Wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs)
2. *ATIs* activation of the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)

## METHODS:
Feed to Mice

## RESULTS
CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-containing cereals have by far the highest concentrations of ATIs that activate TLR4. Orally ingested ATIs are largely resistant to proteases and heat, and increase intestinal inflammation by activating gut and mesenteric lymph node myeloid cells.

# Introduction

##P1: Plant protein substitution for economy

Shortcomings:
  - high carbohydrate levels
  - isoflavones
  - low methionine levels
  - anti-nutritional factors

They can:
  - impede protein digestion
  - impair immune responses
  - intestinal inflammation.

End: Yellow perch is one of the most sensitive species for this change.

## P2: Pancreas
1. Serine-protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and collagenase)
2. Glucosidases
>- hydrolyze starch into lineal chains

## P3: Our purpose
1. Protine and Carbohydrate digestion
2. histology

# M&M
- Chemicals
- Diets, animals and growth experiment
- Post-parndial experiment and sampling
- Preparation of extracts and determination of soluble protein
- Enzyme assays
- Zymograms: characterization of protease fractions and inhibition by PP diets
- Proximal intestine histological analysis
- Statistical analysis

# Results

## Enzymes activities
### Alkaline Protease
- Trout fed diets PP50 and PP75 showed only a slight post-feeding increase in this activity.
- Sea bream fed the FM diet showed a maximum of 6.93±1.03 U protease·mg− 1 protein·min− 1. This value decreased gradually as the percentage of plant protein increased

### Amylase
a significant post-prandial increase in this activity was recorded only in PP75 and PP100 fed trout. Replacement of fish meal by plant protein did not induce significant changes in α-amylase activity in either species.
