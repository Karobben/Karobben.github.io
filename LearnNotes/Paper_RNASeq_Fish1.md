MS-222 & eugenol: Fish anesthetics.

# Abstract

1. M & E are two widely used fish anesthetics.

2. This experiment reveals the transcriptomic changing during the recovering from fish anesthetics (6h after treated).

3. RNA from gills and livers were extracted and compared.

4. Non essential data filled here.

5. Some DEGs participated in human disease and metabolism.(ps: ummmm...WHAT? = =)

6. Two treatment interested different pathways.

7. MS-222 may affect metabolism and immunity and more harmful than eugenol.


PS: *Abstract* briefly introduced the purpose & results of the experiment. First, it revealed the toxicity of two anesthetics, and second, it can improve our understanding on some human diseases(maybe??) and the detoxification of the fish in the transcription level.

# Introduction

P1: What is anesthetics; The contribution of anesthetics; Which anesthetics are available; How do them work;  

P2: Wide geography-distribution(It's an important commercial species). Anesthetic could reduce the mortality during transportation.

P3: Some related experiments had done but not on the same page. So, with the evidences of this experiment, people can make a better choice between MS-222 and eugenol.

# Discussion

## P1-General result from DEGs
1. **Less DEGs** found in eugenol-treated livers sample
2. Pathways associated with human diseases and metabolism were found in **both samples**.  
3. E group is intrested in **detoxification** and **xenobiotics**; M group is interested in **organismal system**

## P2-
1. Stress-> stress related diseases -> imbalance
