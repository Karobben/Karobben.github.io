MS-222 & eugenol: Fish anesthetics.

# Abstract

1. M & E are two widely used fish anesthetics.

2. This experiment reveals the transcriptomic changing during the recovering from fish anesthetics (6h after treated).

3. RNA from gills and livers were extracted and compared.

4. Non essential data filled here.

5. Some DEGs participated in human disease and metabolism.(ps: ummmm...WHAT? = =)

6. Two treatment interested different pathways.

7. MS-222 may affect metabolism and immunity and more harmful than eugenol.


PS: *Abstract* briefly introduced the purpose & results of the experiment. First, it revealed the toxicity of two anesthetics, and second, it can improve our understanding on some human diseases(maybe??) and the detoxification of the fish in the transcription level.

# Introduction

P1: What is anesthetics; The contribution of anesthetics; Which anesthetics are available; How do them work;  

P2: Wide geography-distribution(It's an important commercial species). Anesthetic could reduce the mortality during transportation.

P3: Some related experiments had done but not on the same page. So, with the evidences of this experiment, people can make a better choice between MS-222 and eugenol.

# Discussion

## P1-General result from DEGs
1. **Less DEGs** found in eugenol-treated livers sample
2. Pathways associated with human diseases and metabolism were found in **both samples**.  
3. E group is intrested in **detoxification** and **xenobiotics**; M group is interested in **organismal system**

## P2-Comparative
1. **Stress**

```
2. **Eugenol is less harmful than MS-222**
- Eugenol group: 22 DEGs involved in 30 different pathways related xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism, which means <span style="color:salmon;"><b>detoxification activities of the livers</b></span>.
- MS-222 group: higher levels of AST, ALT, AKP, which reveals MS-222 cause <span style="color:salmon;"><b>more damages to livers</b></span>.(explain: can not be metabolized)
3. **GST** (Glutathione-S-transferase)
- BG: low activity of GST means low detoxification ability.
- Different responses of facing MS-222 in different species from previous research.
- Our result: *L. maculatus* is more vulnerable.
4. **A smaller number of DEGs** may reveals lees intervention of E  compared with M. (PS: = = smaller...)
5. Additionally, eugenol is **natural** and may easier to metabolized.  
(PS: ... Good, I just learned another skill to fill more words on discussion section)

## P3 Stress & Metabolism
1. BG: liver glucose oxidation is enhanced. Amino acid evolved in gluconeogenesis during the stress responses.
2. Those pathways are **enriched in both groups**.
3. Recent start verified *point 1*.

## P4 Pathways involved in environmental information processing
- Jak-STAT signaling, PI3KAkt signaling, TNF signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction.
- BG: HPI->Cotisol; stress can inhibit inflammatory cytokine production and induce apoptosis, proliferation, and phagocytosis of immune cells.
Here: More DEGs related immune-related pathways are found in E group.
- BG: stress affects HPG and may affect reprodctive performance;
Here: Some DEGs involved in productive activities are found in M group.
- BG: Lethimonier observed that stress-induced cortisol inhibited vitellogenesis,
Here: We found it here, too.
- Conclusion: MS-222 is more harmful than eugenol.

## P5 Gill & Livers
Result:  not change the original functions of the organs

## P6 Conclusion
MS-222 revealed that all these anesthetics regulate the metabolic and immune pathways in the fish, and MS-222 may trigger more damages on the fish liver and reproduction.
