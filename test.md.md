- BSFL meal increased the abundance of beneficial microorganisms that contribute to the health of the host such as lactic acid[^Huyben_2019][^Terova_2019][^Rimoldi_2019]and butyrate[^Terova_2019].



- The anti-inflammatory properties of microbe-derived butyrate in gut and its role in enhancing intestinal barrierfunction and mucosal immunity are well studied in human[^Liu_H_2018].


- It is also possible that the short-chain fatty acids including butyrate produced by gut microbiota might induce the expression of host defense peptides and prevent inflammation in the gut as observed in mammals and birds[^Wu_J_2020].
